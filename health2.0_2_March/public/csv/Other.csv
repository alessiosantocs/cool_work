Office of Vermont Health Access,hcr.vermont.gov,"Vermont is in the fifth year of development (and third year of implementation) of a statewide HIE network (or RHIO).

The Vermont legislature and executive share a clear vision for bringing enhanced communication, care coordination, and ""systemness"" to Vermont's health care delivery system. HIT and HIE are key to that effort, but the technology alone is not sufficient to success in achieving our vision.  We understand that the human beings (patients and providers) must be equally engaged and comfortable in this transformation of practice.  Because of the emphasis Vermont has placed on primary care (and the expansion of a sophisticated Medical Home, community care coordination, multi-payer reimbursement model), our HIT & HIE is being built from the ground (patient and provider) up, addressing issues of patient privacy and confidentiality and access to and control over their own data as a critical first step.

The presentation will reveal global patterns and specific regional variances that will help 2.0 stakeholders better focus their e-marketing strategies and forge more lasting relationships with the professionals they are trying to reach. For example, the study reveals that 38% of the participants are members of at least one social network, with Facebook a clear favorite (29%). However, one country broke the trend, reversing the figures with 31% favoring Orkut and only 4% Facebook.  What other differences exist? How are physicians using these networks ? What are their professional and personal use of them ? What are their unmet needs ?The presentation will explore questions such as:•	How can we adopt the best of this new trend to make better Healthcare Marketing ?•	Can medical information gleaned from blogs and forums be trusted ?•	What cultural differences might affect the outcomes ?•	Does this breaching of traditional communication lines mean that eventually we will have one great “melting pot” and eliminate some of the Physician to Patient barriers ?•	How might this information shape marketing messages, website content, customer satisfaction programs ?•	What is the impact of web 2.0 on the healthcare marketing functions ? How should they evolve to survive ?•	How can Marketing executives leverage this information and become Social networking champions within their organizations ?",,false,,,"undergrad-edu:

We launched in 2009 and have secured over a $1 million in funding to develop and test health media around diabetes and cancer. Secondly, we have developed a program of inserting evidence-based health products in common media (Canada's national newspaper and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation among others). Thirdly, we are launching a Family Practice of the Future that will have 5 features (ehealth, interdisciplinary care with new members, building community + tribes, evaluation, and building on the importance of the basic clinical relationship) It has $3 million to launch in July 2010.

Families and social network are resources newly brought into the planning and implementation of care for chronic conditions and challenges related to aging.  Many new technology reports claim an ecosystem focus but do not explain or apply the relevant concepts.  A empowerment cycle in a socioecological context would begin with health habitat as the cornerstone. A medical home would be one part of the health habitat.  Engaging the full range of stakeholders in the paradigm shift implied by ehealth calls for new strategies that recognize strengths and concerns of the various players.  THis calls for new literacies that will challenge patients/families, health professionals, policy makers and advocates.  eHealth success will be powered by engaging consumers and professionals in ubiquitous computing including wearable sensors, games, mobile phone platforms and technology still in the dream state.
