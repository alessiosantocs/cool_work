By built environment, we are referring to mixed use and/or master planned communities, where people live, work and play. We are developing a set of actual and virtual tools to enable real estate developers, master planners, architects and others to incorporate and coordinate wellness products and services easily into their projects from the very outset, with the consumer......s needs and interests in mind, rather than as an afterthought.

TouMetis,www.toumetis.com,"Title:Unleashing new and powerful applications with new Web StandardsAbstract:With the release of new Web standards such as HTML 5, the healthcare community can create a continuum of information for the healthcare providers and patients.  The barriers associated with creating applications that worked across multiple operating systems and device types were expensive to develop and difficult to support. For example, what happens to the application when a user doesn't have Internet or network connection. This prevented many creative healthcare initiatives to develop.  With new browser standards such as HTML 5, solutions can be developed that support multiple operating systems such as Windows and OS X, as well as, device types such as desktops, notebooks, NetBook, smartphones and Internet appliances.  Not only do these applications work when connected to the Internet, they are designed to work off-line in remote or disconnected environments. In addition, these applications provide the capability of providing alerts and notifications to help everyone stay in compliance.This session will talk about unleashing the power of the new Web standards.  The ability to create a single application that works on multiple devices.  The session points out the use of mobile phones as a critical information vehicle for healthcare providers and patients. The new web standards will create a new paradigm shift in developing applications that provides the right information, to the right person, at the right time.",,false,,,"undergrad-edu:

NuEra Health Alliance,http:nu-erahealth.com/,"NuEra Health Alliance is a consulting firm with two major focus areas.  The first is to help propel the healthcare industry,  and more specifically, pharma, towards faster adoption of emerging technologies.  Having been in big pharma for many years, we understand the bureacracy and current mindset of organizations and we can strategically assist technology companies to appropriately position themselves, guide the organizational change management that will be required for adoption and lend credibility to the ......cause'.  To put it simply, we believe we can help 'build a bridge' between the two industries.  Our second area of focus is patients-the real reason why both of us have been in the industry for so long.  We are passionate about arming patients and physicians with the tools that will lead to improved healthcare.  We are on the look-out for patient related tools that will empower patients to become better advocates for their own health and will do everything we can to help move those tools into the hands of folks that need them!

Our products and services are designed to build a bridge from the current practice processes and systems to compliance with the HITECH criteria.

Medimix International,http:www.medimix.net,"Medimix International in partnership with Alexandre de Carvalho, adjunct professor of social media at the University of Miami, will present a survey completed in the second part of 2009, among 500 GPs, oncologists, hematologists, and cardiologists in ten different countries (Europe Top Five, United States, Brazil, Mexico, and Asia),  to study their use of social media and professional networking sites.   The presentation will reveal global patterns and specific regional variances that will help 2.0 stakeholders better focus their e-marketing strategies and forge more lasting relationships with the professionals they are trying to reach. For example, the study reveals that 38% of the participants are members of at least one social network, with Facebook a clear favorite (29%). However, one country broke the trend, reversing the figures with 31% favoring Orkut and only 4% Facebook.  What other differences exist? How are physicians using these networks ? What are their professional and personal use of them ? What are their unmet needs ?The presentation will explore questions such as:•	How can we adopt the best of this new trend to make better Healthcare Marketing ?•	Can medical information gleaned from blogs and forums be trusted ?•	What cultural differences might affect the outcomes ?•	Does this breaching of traditional communication lines mean that eventually we will have one great “melting pot” and eliminate some of the Physician to Patient barriers ?•	How might this information shape marketing messages, website content, customer satisfaction programs ?•	What is the impact of web 2.0 on the healthcare marketing functions ? How should they evolve to survive ?•	How can Marketing executives leverage this information and become Social networking champions within their organizations ?",,false,,,"undergrad-edu:
