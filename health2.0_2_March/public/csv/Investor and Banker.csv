Phoenix Capital Management,www.phxcapital.com,"Phoenix Capital Management was founded in 2000 to invest in or acquire companies where our financial and strategic resources can create significant value for our investment. We do not focus on any particular industry although we have significant experience in health care, retailing, financial services and natural resources. We seek to actively manage companies and to work with existing management teams to create long term strategic value. We do not shy away from turnaround situations where we can mitigate risk and see a clear path to the creation of value. We seek extraordinary rates of returns in everything we do.Occasionally we will serve as investment banking advisors in situations where we can effectively use our vast contacts in the financial markets. We have significant experience in raising private and public capital through institutional investors. Members of our firm have been involved in over $10 Billion of capital financings over the past 20 years.",,false,,,"undergrad-edu:

Maveron,http:www.maveron.com,"Per my email correspondence with Hillary McCowen, I am submitting Maveron's Clayton Lewis to share his experience (not a product) as an investor in many successful natural health-products companies. Hillary told me that Lizzie would be in touch with me on how Clayton may fit into one of the expert panels. Below are panel-topic suggestions that Clayton could lend unique expertise:   1.       How are major companies driving utilization of wellness programs to have a positive impact (ROI) on insurance claims plus enhance employee engagement and productivity?  2.       What disruptive models in primary care are gaining traction and what does this mean for the future consumer of health?  Please be in touch with me, Allison Busch, as I am organizing Clayton?s involvement. My contact information is included in the speaker form. Thank you!! Clayton joined Maveron in 2007 and is focused on the firm?s health and wellness companies. Clayton has an extensive background in driving operations and a strong track record of returns. Below is a sampling health and wellness companies in which Maveron has invested and grown:   Kinetix, which provides customized health and nutrition programs to corporate clients and individuals across the country.  NextFoods, the wellness company that produces a probiotic fruit juice under the name of GoodBelly, a proprietary blend of organic fruit juices and clinically substantiated probiotics.  lucy activewear, which designs and produces fashionable clothing for active women.
