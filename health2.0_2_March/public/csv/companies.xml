    <description>We are an early stage startup focusing on integrating the best wellness and health resources seamlessly into the built environment. By built environment, we are referring to mixed use and/or master planned communities, where people live, work and play. We are developing a set of actual and virtual tools to enable real estate developers, master planners, architects and others to incorporate and coordinate wellness products and services easily into their projects from the very outset, with the consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\......s needs and interests in mind, rather than as an afterthought. BluePond believes that by working from this point, it is possible to significantly enhance people\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s quality of life across the lifespan and engage individuals more creatively in their own well-being. Our approach is complementary to, but significantly different from, that of the healthcare industry in that we are focusing on change from the ground up, literally, shaping the design of the built environment where people spend the majority of their time, using an interactive, iterative approach.</description>

We help clients stay open to the new, the unique, the breakthrough, and get seen and talked about in places and ways competitors haven\'t even thought about yet. So, yes. We do PR, globally, for more than 20 years. But once you get to know us, you\'ll not worry about a label. You\'ll just be thinking about what we can do together:

    <description>Title:

Unleashing new and powerful applications with new Web Standards

Abstract:

With the release of new Web standards such as HTML 5, the healthcare community can create a continuum of information for the healthcare providers and patients.  The barriers associated with creating applications that worked across multiple operating systems and device types were expensive to develop and difficult to support. For example, what happens to the application when a user doesn\'t have Internet or network connection. This prevented many creative healthcare initiatives to develop.  With new browser standards such as HTML 5, solutions can be developed that support multiple operating systems such as Windows and OS X, as well as, device types such as desktops, notebooks, NetBook, smartphones and Internet appliances.  Not only do these applications work when connected to the Internet, they are designed to work off-line in remote or disconnected environments. In addition, these applications provide the capability of providing alerts and notifications to help everyone stay in compliance. 
This session will talk about unleashing the power of the new Web standards.  The ability to create a single application that works on multiple devices.  The session points out the use of mobile phones as a critical information vehicle for healthcare providers and patients. The new web standards will create a new paradigm shift in developing applications that provides the right information, to the right person, at the right time.</description>

    <description>In our proposed architecture, patients will passively acquire \'observations of daily living\' using Continua Alliance certified devices including weight scales and pedometers, as well as a Cypak \'Report Card\' to record Gastrointestinal Symptoms.  After passing through a middleware solution provided by IBM and Google, the data will be presented in a rich, game-like Adobe Flex application designed to display trend lines and data points in a game like interface, as patients progress over time.    The stated goal of Crohnology.MD is to visually enhance the patient narrative, by presenting patient observations in a structured, shareable and visually compelling way that answers the all important question: \&quot;How does the patient feel?\&quot;    Crohnology.MD has developed an innovative proposal in conjunction with a trio of grant \'graft on\' partners including IBM, Google, and IDEO, who have collaborated to architect a proposed open source health care information service system that allows patients to record and widely share their \'observations of daily living\'.  Observations of Daily living can include weight, pain, fatigue, nausea, and various gastrointestinal symptoms relevant to Crohn\'s disease. </description>

    <description>Health 2.0 Makes Information Therapy Possible

Health 2.0 for the first time makes Information Therapy practical and possible. Health 2.0 is about individuals creating and sharing more of themselves online in a way that improves their own health, the health of others they are connected to, and the health of the community as a whole. Information therapy is based on the idea that what we think and believe -- the content of our minds -- can influence our health, either directly or through our behavior, and that we can change and influence the content of our minds and therefore also our health through information media. Personalized health, however, is infinitely diverse, and if we had to design the right information therapy for the right person at the right time, we would never finish the job. So how does Health 2.0 make information therapy possible? The needs in health care are so diverse, so complex, so personalized, and so rapidly changing, that information therapy derived from a scripted template cannot fully address the diversity of needs. Without Health 2.0, the greater the number and diversity of people with health needs, the more infinitely complex the situation becomes. Health 2.0, on the other hand, changes the information therapy equation. Because the participants also are co-creators, selectors, navigators, recommenders, and reviewers of content, the more people involved the greater their diversity, the more possible it is to meet everyone&#8217;s needs. While some traditionalists might argue about evidence-based information, the reality is that rich and diverse Health 2.0 communities are also enabling an acceleration of evidence gathering and controlled research to generate new knowledge about how information therapy works and what works for whom, so that we may truly learn how the right information can be given to the right person at the right time to improve health.

    <description>Vermont is in the fifth year of development (and third year of implementation) of a statewide HIE network (or RHIO). That work is being done, primarily through the state funding noted above, by VITL (Vermont Information Technology Leaders), in collaboration with the Vermont Department of Health, the Vermont Department of Information and Innovation, and the Vermont Blueprint for Health, with the coordination of the Office of Vermont Health Access &amp; Health Care Reform.    The Vermont legislature and executive share a clear vision for bringing enhanced communication, care coordination, and &quot;systemness&quot; to Vermont's health care delivery system. HIT and HIE are key to that effort, but the technology alone is not sufficient to success in achieving our vision.  We understand that the human beings (patients and providers) must be equally engaged and comfortable in this transformation of practice.  Because of the emphasis Vermont has placed on primary care (and the expansion of a sophisticated Medical Home, community care coordination, multi-payer reimbursement model), our HIT &amp; HIE is being built from the ground (patient and provider) up, addressing issues of patient privacy and confidentiality and access to and control over their own data as a critical first step.  </description>

    <description>NuEra Health Alliance is a consulting firm with two major focus areas.  The first is to help propel the healthcare industry,  and more specifically, pharma, towards faster adoption of emerging technologies.  Having been in big pharma for many years, we understand the bureacracy and current mindset of organizations and we can strategically assist technology companies to appropriately position themselves, guide the organizational change management that will be required for adoption and lend credibility to the ......cause\'.  To put it simply, we believe we can help \'build a bridge\' between the two industries.  Our second area of focus is patients-the real reason why both of us have been in the industry for so long.  We are passionate about arming patients and physicians with the tools that will lead to improved healthcare.  We are on the look-out for patient related tools that will empower patients to become better advocates for their own health and will do everything we can to help move those tools into the hands of folks that need them!    </description>

    <description>Dura Health Concepts provides physicians with market-leading, innovative and secure consulting and implementation solutions required to integrate electronic health records systems and processes into physician practices.  

Dura Health is not a vendor and will leverage the scale of the physician community to deliver a cost-effective, doctor-first product that will allow all physicians access to the financial, efficiency, and patient health benefits of EHR systems.  Our products and services are designed to build a bridge from the current practice processes and systems to compliance with the HITECH criteria.  This will improve the practice performance and position our partner physicians to take advantage of the government incentives.    There is a deficiency of the technical resources necessary for small physician practices and solo practitioners to deploy and meaningfully use EHR systems.  Dura Health Concepts fills this void.  </description>

The system helps users set weight loss goals jointly with nutrition specialists, generate personalized food plans and help user follow their plan (while making dynamic adaptations should a user deviate from it). The mycoachnutrition.com web site will also provide on-line receipes, help users understand nutrition principlesand create a community of user space so that people can help each other. In collaboration with another French startup, it will also provide a space for sports and health management. V1 of the system will be operational in October 2010.</description>

    <description>The first metaphor that comes to mind for me in hearing &#8220;Connecting Consumers to Providers&#8221; is that of a &#8220;Marketplace&#8221;.  Providers are selling and consumers are buying? 

Accepting this analogy, I would like to discuss the supply chain, products to be sold, quality assurance of products, price transparency, meeting unmet needs, convenience shopping, etc.  

It would also be interesting to have some dialogue around the role of the pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device industry&#8217;s role in funding such a 
marketplace.  Perhaps, providers are really not the sellers, but rather the middlemen, the conduit through which the drug manufactures target the consumer.

    <description>Personal Health Records and Completion of phase I of Project Health Design
Project HealthDesign Overview

Funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), with additional support from the California HealthCare Foundation, Project HealthDesign is a $4.4 million national program designed to support health and information technology pioneers to create a new generation of personal health record (PHR) systems. Administered by a national program office at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Project HealthDesign&#8217;s goal is to design and test a suite of PHR tools and applications that work together to help people achieve their various and specific health goals in an integrated fashion. The program is supported by the Foundation&#8217;s Pioneer Portfolio, which funds innovative projects that can lead to fundamental breakthroughs in the health and health care of all Americans.

This bold new program will build on and extend the range of uses offered by existing PHRs by supporting multidisciplinary teams to design and test a broad spectrum of innovations in how consumers can use information technology to better manage their health and more easily navigate the health care system. Project HealthDesign challenges health experts and technology designers to push the envelope in thinking about the transformative potential of PHRs and design PHR systems that can exist on a common platform.

In this two-phased, 18-month initiative, nine design teams will participate in a six-month structured process to create user-centered personal health applications that address specific health challenges faced by individuals and families. In the subsequent 12-month prototype phase, these personal health applications will be tested in target populations.

The program&#8217;s objectives are to:

    *
      Develop innovative designs for PHR products and services that can help individuals and their families manage important health challenges</description>

    <description>The Health Triangle: the Internet, the Physician, and the Patient
Far too often, patients don\\......t talk to their doctors about their online activities or turn a consultation into a confrontation. At the same time, physicians don\\\'t know enough about what their patients are doing online before and following appointments and rarely address their patients\\\' online activities into an appointment. My research is on how to create more successful partnerships that work within the healthcare system\\\'s constraints while better supporting patients who are trying to diagnose and solve a health problem yet may be hampered by poor health literacy skills. </description>

    <description>This is the first study of psychiatric consultations undertaken using asynchronous, or store-and-forward, web-based telepsychiatry (ATP). We have undertaken 100 non-emergency psychiatric consultations using ATP with English and Spanish speaking primary care patients living in Tulare County, a medically underserved area in the California Central Valley. This presentation will demonstrate the software we have built and will describe the process of ATP, as well as the potential advantages of using the internet to provide cross-language clinical consultations. The next stage of the project is to examine diagnostic validity and inter-rater reliability. This study has significant implications for the way that psychiatric consultations on the internet can be provided to patients around the world, and may open the way to an entirely new approach to undertaking web-based psychiatric consultations.</description>

This presentation will explore how the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has leveraged 2.0 technologies, strategies, and applications to help keep the public informed about the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. CDC has used multiple platforms to provide information to the public where, when, and how they need to take preventive actions. Millions of Americans have been reached through these efforts via YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Podcasts, Flickr, mHealth applications, and many others. During this response, CDC has addressed the first 21st century outbreak with 21st century communication. Lessons from this experience are relevant for many different situations and many different sectors. </description>

    <description>We have implemented in Santa Clara county a location-based, mobile application that will provide patients, who need an urgent care visit, information about the next available appointment at their PCP......s office or at the local urgent care center.  This application can proactively divert avoidable ER visits to either urgent care centers or PCP offices, saving costs and providing higher quality care.  If the patient feels these times are not fast enough, they can use the app to forward clinical information in a continuing care document to a participating ER.  When they get to the ER, the location-based technology will identify them and the app will push to the ER physician, the patient\'s pharmacy, laboratory, radiology and current problem list.  Even if the patient does not activate the app on the way to the ER, the technology will sense real-time that the patient is in a participating ER and the medical management team can reach out to the patient the following morning to reconnect them to their PCP, thus reducing multiple visits to the ER.  This also provides the medical group a seamless, simple method to identify practices that are making the extra effort to accommodate urgent care visits and thus, can be used to bonus these practices.  Bonusing practices for accommodating urgent care visits provides a pathway toward greater adoption of advanced access (same day PCP visits).</description>

    <description>Medimix International in partnership with Alexandre de Carvalho, adjunct professor of social media at the University of Miami, will present a survey completed in the second part of 2009, among 500 GPs, oncologists, hematologists, and cardiologists in ten different countries (Europe Top Five, United States, Brazil, Mexico, and Asia),  to study their use of social media and professional networking sites.   The presentation will reveal global patterns and specific regional variances that will help 2.0 stakeholders better focus their e-marketing strategies and forge more lasting relationships with the professionals they are trying to reach. For example, the study reveals that 38% of the participants are members of at least one social network, with Facebook a clear favorite (29%). However, one country broke the trend, reversing the figures with 31% favoring Orkut and only 4% Facebook.  What other differences exist? How are physicians using these networks ? What are their professional and personal use of them ? What are their unmet needs ?
The presentation will explore questions such as:  
&#8226;	How can we adopt the best of this new trend to make better Healthcare Marketing ?  
&#8226;	Can medical information gleaned from blogs and forums be trusted ?
&#8226;	What cultural differences might affect the outcomes ? 
&#8226;	Does this breaching of traditional communication lines mean that eventually we will have one great &#8220;melting pot&#8221; and eliminate some of the Physician to Patient barriers ?
&#8226;	How might this information shape marketing messages, website content, customer satisfaction programs ? 
&#8226;	What is the impact of web 2.0 on the healthcare marketing functions ? How should they evolve to survive ?
&#8226;	How can Marketing executives leverage this information and become Social networking champions within their organizations ?</description>

    <description>Pfizer: Using Social Media to Change Digital Healthcare Consumer Behaviour 

Digital healthcare consumers are put at risk through the purchase of medicine from illegal online pharmacies. Counterfeit medicines purchased from such pharmacies have been found to contain dangerous substances and even cause death. In response, Pfizer in the UK is using a digital engagement approach to change the behaviour online health consumers.

Pfizer&#8217;s &#8216;Real Danger&#8217; Counterfeit Medicine Campaign:
In 2009, after analysing the behaviour of digital healthcare consumers searching for prescription medicines online, and the illegal activity of unregistered online pharmacies, Pfizer launched a campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of counterfeit medicines. 

The campaign successfully engages the online community amidst the highly regulated pharmaceutical environment, and brings Pfizer closer than ever to healthcare consumers on important health issues.

Pfizer&#8217;s &#8216;Get Real&#8217; campaign uses social media and viral marketing without attracting inappropriate commentary. &#8216;Health 2.0&#8217; components include strategies for search, proactive social media monitoring and online community engagement.

The presentation will illustrate how:
-Real-time measurement of digital consumer behaviour activity ensures relevant engagement 
-Multiple stakeholder collaboration strengthens digital engagement
-A multi-channel, organic digital strategy maximises online impact from above-the-line communication
-Understanding search activity enables successful digital user interception
-Consumer behaviour is changed through digital engagement

This is an ongoing campaign which, by the Health2.0 Conference in April 2010 will have produced further insights that will be shared at the conference.</description>

We launched in 2009 and have secured over a $1 million in funding to develop and test health media around diabetes and cancer. Secondly, we have developed a program of inserting evidence-based health products in common media (Canada's national newspaper and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation among others). Thirdly, we are launching a Family Practice of the Future that will have 5 features (ehealth, interdisciplinary care with new members, building community + tribes, evaluation, and building on the importance of the basic clinical relationship) It has $3 million to launch in July 2010. These three projects are highly overlapping.</description>

We also stimulate and facilitate our customers in taking an active part in the care they receive. Recently we're orientating ourselves on the role health 2.0 can play in this. One of the things we're considering is making the participation in PHR-like tools part of contracting healthcare.
The role that healthcare insurance companies can play in stimulating, facilitating and financing of health 2.0  developments is from my point of view highly underestimated and highlighted. I would love to commentate on all kinds of topics especially those concerning patient social networks, consumer tools and the governments point of view.</description>

Yet there is evidence that user will form a new type of relationship with such devices that is differernt from normal consumer products. Many such devices will learn from users and hold intimate information about us. It will prevent manufacturers advertise and promoting products using the same techniques as consumer devices. 
Persona, the contraceptive system, launched in 1997 and still successful in Europe was the first Smart product that learned from its user. It gives valuable insight into the challenges and opportunities this new sector will face. As its designer and developer I would like to speak on the lessons it shows us.</description>

    <description>Would like to comment on moving health care professionals into new partnerships with consumers.  Families and social network are resources newly brought into the planning and implementation of care for chronic conditions and challenges related to aging.  Many new technology reports claim an ecosystem focus but do not explain or apply the relevant concepts.  A empowerment cycle in a socioecological context would begin with health habitat as the cornerstone. A medical home would be one part of the health habitat.  Engaging the full range of stakeholders in the paradigm shift implied by ehealth calls for new strategies that recognize strengths and concerns of the various players.  THis calls for new literacies that will challenge patients/families, health professionals, policy makers and advocates.  eHealth success will be powered by engaging consumers and professionals in ubiquitous computing including wearable sensors, games, mobile phone platforms and technology still in the dream state.  All of this must be accomplished with new attention to cultural variation--both ethnic and generational.</description>

    <description>Dear People at Health 2.0 Paris

Seems I just missed the deadline. Needed some time to clear my agenda. I......ll still give it a try. 
I\'m convinced I can offer a valuable contribution to the physicians and online communities topic, as our group has hands-on experience with doing G.P. consults on Twitter. See http://twitter.com/tweetspreekuur. We launched our initiative mid october, only two weeks after the idea was born, on the Reshape09 conference in Nijmegen, the Netherlands (see http://reshape2009.com/en/) Led by two motto\'s:  .....The proof of the pudding is in the eating\&quot; and \&quot;Learning by Doing\&quot; we just took off. Created quite a bit of media attention, a growing group of followers and many questions and answers. Social community at its best! I would like to contribute our experience and share thoughts and ideas with the brightest minds in the international 2.0 community on how to expand and strengthen the social media health network</description>

    <description>Stichting Zorg e-Novatie  (Foundation Zorg e-Novatie) is a not-for profit organization which supports the development and promotion of Open Source in Healthcare. The Foundation has taken the initiative to develop AeXist Diabetes: an Open Source Diabetes Application. A user group (patients and clinicians) has provided input in the development process. 

AeXist Diabetes has been developed from a patient perspective. The patient can regulate his diabetes with the application and communicate directly with his physician.

The physician has a complete overview of the patient: what are the health objectives, which checks have been performed, which checks are open, what are the glucose trends etc.
 
The application is based on the Diabetes Healthcare Standard as developed by the Dutch Diabetes Federation. 

From a technical point of view the characteristics are as follows:

-          the application has been developed on an Open Source platform: Orbeon forms (www.orbeon.com) and eXist XML-database (http://exist.sourceforge.net/)
-          the architecture and datamodel is based on the international HL7V3 Information model (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Level_7)
-          the user interface is based on X-Forms, data is stored in a native XML-database
- data is coded through  SNOMED-CT
-          the application is easy to integrate with existing applications
-          user has access to the application through a PC or smart phone
-          the application confirms to the privacy and safety regulations as defined in The Netherlands
-          modular set-up which allows easy development of modules for other diseases

 
We are looking forward for the ability to share our experience at the conference.

    <description>Per my email correspondence with Hillary McCowen, I am submitting Maveron's Clayton Lewis to share his experience (not a product) as an investor in many successful natural health-products companies. Hillary told me that Lizzie would be in touch with me on how Clayton may fit into one of the expert panels. Below are panel-topic suggestions that Clayton could lend unique expertise:   1.       How are major companies driving utilization of wellness programs to have a positive impact (ROI) on insurance claims plus enhance employee engagement and productivity?  2.       What disruptive models in primary care are gaining traction and what does this mean for the future consumer of health?  Please be in touch with me, Allison Busch, as I am organizing Clayton?s involvement. My contact information is included in the speaker form. Thank you!! Clayton joined Maveron in 2007 and is focused on the firm?s health and wellness companies. Clayton has an extensive background in driving operations and a strong track record of returns. Below is a sampling health and wellness companies in which Maveron has invested and grown:   Kinetix, which provides customized health and nutrition programs to corporate clients and individuals across the country.  NextFoods, the wellness company that produces a probiotic fruit juice under the name of GoodBelly, a proprietary blend of organic fruit juices and clinically substantiated probiotics.  lucy activewear, which designs and produces fashionable clothing for active women. </description>

    <description>This is a very *very* early stage start up that has not progressed beyond a business plan and some detailed mock-ups.  The essential idea is based on the observation that better search brings better efficiencies to markets.  

At the moment, a common complaint among many health care seekers is their inability to find a good doctor.  I have performed some research which gives a bit more context to this observation, but the overall focus of the company is to provide *one* place where a health care consumer could find healthcare providers, including physicians (of course), but also chiropractors, nutritionists, psychologists, nurse practitioners, acupuncturists, off-shore medical centers (for medical vacations), and so on.  

Starting with this set of data, and a relentless focus on usability and ease of use, I believe we can provide a service that no one is focused on providing.  Competitors are usually focused on selling other services into their physician search sites.  I believe this limits their effectiveness and trustworthiness. 

It is my belief that a site with a single focus and doing one thing well will resonate with users and ultimately be successful.</description>

    <description>We are developing a platform for collecting and sharing of consumer price information for health care services.  Our goal is to enable consumers to share price information that can help others find the best value. 

OutofPocket.com is an online resource to help consumers look-up prices and find the best value for routine health care services.  The website relies on consumer collaboration to collect and share true prices consumers paid for health care services, along with personal recommendations on the provider.  Consumers use www.outofpocket.com to help them make informed decisions before purchasing routine health care services.  

The OutofPocket.com directory contains prices collected from several different sources including:

-- Consumer Generated Content: Consumers anonymously post prices they paid for routine health care services, (including MRIs, mammograms, X-rays, lab tests, vaccinations, dental, vision and office visits), along with their personal recommendations on the provider 

A soft release of the website was launched in July 2007 and we are currently working on the next release of the site, and hope to have it launched by year end.  

-- Providers that Disclose Pricing: Providers are invited to submit true prices for their services for inclusion in the directory 

-- Government CMS: Medicare payment data for common medical procedures

    <description>Two years ago I polled my Rugby Club as to who had health insurance.  25% of our players had no health coverage.  I had the time, so I got my insurance licenses, and started RuckingInsurance.com.  I also blog about Health Insurance issues for Ruggers at ruckinginsurance.blogspot.com.

The player's basic complaints were either health insurance was too expensive or too complicated.  I am able to educate this small niche simply because I can speak &quot;rugby.&quot;  Agents should find something they enjoy &quot;off the clock&quot; and market to those participants.  The tension of &quot;insurance agent&quot; is then decreased.  </description>

    <description>We are a healthcare IT company that focuses on connectivity services, Cisco Advanced Unified Communications, medical applications, and the advanced development of EDI.  
   
In concurrence with our present services, we've developed our own software that connects disparate Medical applications with one another and integrates with Cisco UC.  This unique combination of interfacing, communications and device integration is called EXTENSION&#174;.  We have found that there are many products available that specialize on one or two of these areas, but not all three combined--which makes our product very unique.

Our biggest focus is on the advancement of clinical data sharing and mobility.  We hope that our new product will solve a broad spectrum of issues that healthcare faces today, namely the ease of sharing clinical data, the mobility of data, reducing the inefficiencies related to disparate medical applications, and overall fueling adoption of electronic medical records.

As a reseller of Cisco Advanced Unified Communications and various medical applications, it has been a appropriate fit that we develop this software.  We have years of experience in technical and clinical implementation.  Our experiences in the healthcare setting have made us realize the disparity of data between applications, understand the time involved in implementing a 1:1 interface, and see firsthand the workarounds that hospitals and other large healthcare groups use to accommodate each other.

    <description>COHO's mission is to define, measure and promote a culture of health in the home, workplace and community.  While personal health is an altruistic societal goal, other than smoking cessation, there is little other behavior change (of a personal, commercial or community nature) that has risen to the level of becoming part of our culture.  And when a movement becomes enculturated, powerful forces are unleashed that can do more than any policy or program - whether private or governmental - ever could.  Therein lay the vision for the Culture of Health Organization.

The most significant missing element to transform health from an ideal to a movement is leadership; leadership on a family unit basis, in the workplace and on a community/governmental level.  To address this deficit, we are building a founding board of advisers who will bring leadership credentials from the world of consumer engagement, business, and community activism/government.  These individuals will contribute their expertise and guidance gleaned from the fields of consumer marketing, social anthropology/culture development and public policy development let alone health and health care.

As the organization grows, we will be open to all contributors and collaborators with the intent of pulling in otherwise competing commercial entities (e.g., health plans, consultants/brokers, pharma) and related non-profits (e.g., APHA, NBGH, PBGH, IBI) in a way that makes it worth their while to participate with COHO rather than going it alone.

The seminal event for COHO will be its inaugural conference slated for Q4'08 or Q1'09.  From that point forward, COHO will be a self-sustaining non-profit with revenues derived from:
-- annual membership (organizational entity memberships and organizations sponsoring individuals; i.e., an employer sponsoring each of their employees for $1 per year)
-- benchmarking / data
-- Culture of Health certification and ongoing royalties
-- Royalties from &quot;Healthy Reality&quot; - a technology/service incubator combined with a TV reality module embedded in an existing TV show (e.g., Oprah, Rachel Ray, Today, Discovery Channel, The Food Network).

Clearly Health 2.0 is focused on the supply side of this critically important transformation in health and health care.  With the exception of Health Reality (see above), COHO will be more about the demand side of the equation.  Consequently, I see our two organizations as highly synergistic.</description>

Right now we're one of the best sites for information and images about skin diseases and other visual conditions.  We're working now to broaden our scope beyond just disease information to create a place for communities to come together around these skin health related topics.

VisualDxHealth.com is the consumer version of a clinicial decision support system used in emergency departments around the world.  Our key differentiators are an easy to use interface to &quot;find your disease&quot; and the world's best collection of dermatologic images.  Why read several paragraphs describing a condition, when a picture can do the work for you faster and better.

We're also very interested in other web technologies to help distribute information.  As an example, we've embraced web widgets as a way to let bloggers and other health sites add our trusted health content to their sites.  Web widgets are exciting and engaging but we think they can be used for more than just marketing, slideshows, and reincarnting 80s video games.</description>

    <description>Improve health care outcomes through educational services that foster more effective clinican/patient partnerships and support positive health behavior change

The Internet has become consumers' primary source for health information, but their doctor remains their most trusted resource.  Consumers seek to verify Internet health information by sharing it during medical consultations.  Clinicians are challenged to quickly and skillfully appraise the information and relate it to the patient&#8217;s care.  This new interpretive role is consistent with the goals of patient-centered care, but is often problematic for the clinician.  The mission of our new venture is to help clinicians and patients partner more effectively on education, positive behavior change and improved health outcomes.

Women's Healthcare Forum (WHF) was established in 2001 by The Foundation for Better Health Care, a non-profit continuing medical education provider accredited by the ACCME.  WHF produces the largest continuing medical education program exclusively dedicated to comprehensive and integrative health care for women.  Our 8,000+ members are US-based primary care clinicians (FM, IM, OBGYN).</description>

    <description>We believe it could be much easier for people with chronic conditions to take ownership for their health.  Ownership requires a high-value, low-cost ongoing partnership between patients and providers.  We aim to solve the two most basic problems in healthcare &#8211; lack of patient ownership and effective partnership between patient and providers.   These twin peaks create misunderstanding, missed opportunity, excessive diagnostics, wasted care and inferior outcomes.  We provide web-based platforms to help patients and providers solve these problems to improve outcomes and decrease costs.

We have 'pre-loaded' our platforms for musculoskeletal conditions (back pain, arthritis, carpal tunnel, etc.) based on their prevalence, fit with what we offer and unmet need.  

Specifically, our tools do 4 things...

1.  Facilitate good, cost-effective conversations. 
Evidence based decision support for doctors and patients.    After Visit Summaries.  Pre and Post-Op instructions.  Health Gateway allows providers to create customized treatment plans for patients and then monitor and support patient compliance and outcomes.  Also serves as the point of care coordination for providers (eg, PCP, NP, PT, surgeon)

2.  Make new behaviors easy and automatic. 
&#8216;Solution packages&#8217; for each condition.  Reminder Tool helps people incorporate exercises, treatments and lifestyle changes into their lives.    Health Rewards encourage people to use programs, record their outcomes and improve their health.  Health Family engages the whole family to win movie tickets and dinners out. 

3.  Record treatments and outcomes.
Our tools create an integrated perspective of treatments and outcomes for each patient. We make it easy and worthwhile for patients to record outcomes.

4.  Interoperate.  
Seamlessly share data with PHRs/EHRs/EMRs.  Allow providers to easily add their own content to Health Gateway.  We have &#8216;pre-loaded&#8217; our tools for musculoskeletal conditions.  It is straightforward to load other conditions.

Cancerfocus.net and dotcure.com are cancer news and search technologies providing tools for both patients and cancer researchers. We strive to provide a direct link between the cancer research community (PhD's) and patients on what emerging technologies are applicable to their cases. This information can then arm them in their discussions with their primary provider and may even help to cause direct changes to the protocols followed at many second tier hospitals around the country.

We are also developing tools for the scientific community to aid in archiving and presenting data in the literature used in our day to day work.

We are a Google News site turned Google Blog site as the lack of funding precludes me from involving as many of my colleagues as I would like.

    <description>We offer an Identity as a Service solution called Videntity.  It is an ideal platform for health care and os accessible via a secure, RESTful, Application Programming Interface (API).

Please see http://videntity.com for a brief (pre-launch) product description.

A few &quot;MUST HAVE&quot; features of Videntity Include:

-Customizable Telephone-based Identity Verification AND Authorization.   (Its not just verifying identity, but getting express permission for something)  We have a novel, patent-pending, two-way identity verification that prevents &quot;vishing&quot; (i.e. telephone based phishing scams).

-Text Message Notifications

- Biometric Verification (Voice, Iris, Fingerprint)

-Automatic Digitizing and Codification of paper documents through a fax machine.

All of the technology is our own including voice recognition, iris recognition, paper digitization/codification, etc.  We're the identity experts.

Below is some information not yet on the website which can give you a better understanding of how Videntity works:

How to Use Videntity in Just 3 Easy Steps

Step 1: Sign Up.  Sign up to receive an Entity (Organizational) account and an API key to access the service.  Enjoy a 60 Day free trial.  Service fees are based on the number of accounts created and the volume of transactions. Click Here to See the Current Pricing.    Optionally, you can setup a Videntity Server on your local host to automatic receive data.

The next steps can be performed by your applications or one of the samples clients provided for free at http://videntity.com/downloads

Step 2: Create Your Accounts.  Create &#8220;Agent Accounts&#8221; for your Agents, Employees, or anyone who will be acting on behalf of the Entity Organization. (More on Agent Accounts...)  Create &#8220;Population Accounts&#8221; for your  your general user base. Depending on your requirements, these user make up your Customers, Account Holders, Patients, General Public, Devices, etc.  (More on Population Accounts....)

Step 3: Use Videntity.  Send and receive transactions from Videntity.   There are two main transaction types, &#8220;Send&#8221; and &#8220;Request&#8221;.  The verification and communications portions of the transaction are handled automatically by Videntity.  Videntity will handle the transaction differently based on the makeup of the transaction, the entity's settings, and user account settings.  Transactions and their responses follow a very simple, straightforward, schema.   Please see the Developer Wiki and the API documentation for more detailed information.  Also, help yourself to free sample applications, many many of which include source code.

    <description>PhysiciansWorkplace.com is dedicated to improving patient care by linking employed physicians to each other, their employers and future employers.
As physicians, especially primary care and increasingly surgical specialties, become W-2 employees, there may develop a misapplication of organizational mission: that is to improve the health of those that are served. Decision makers in these organizations are increasingly non-physicians and they may desire the phsyician perspective on a range of strategic and operational imperatives. Current models of an employed Chief Medical Officer are as effective as the individual that holds that position. Organizations that seek the employment of motivated and innovative physicians would open to all sources of thinking from their employed phsyicians. The mass of knowledge employed physicians hold can give insight into the market the organization serves, potential solutions to barriers within the organization that limit service and the development of new markets.

The method of gathering that information relies on communication. The most efficient form of communication would be the internet. The only site deicated to this form of communication is PhysiciansWorkplace.com</description>

    <description>From a press release, Sept 18, 2008 (Note: the site is currently password protected until final legal release is achieved from Revolution Health)

***

Val Jones, M.D., award-winning writer and former Senior Medical Director of Revolution Health.com, launched a new medical blog and health website today called, &#8220;Getting Better with Dr. Val&#8221; to provide accurate medical information in a trusted environment that allows everyone to make well-informed healthcare decisions.

&#8220;Accurate information is the foundation for intelligent health decisions,&#8221; said Dr. Jones. &#8220;We are committed to educating the public about their options without the hype and exaggeration that can be so common in the media.&#8221;

    <description>I have been working on two principle web based programs. The first is a Health registry site providing patients with financial gifts / donation to receive their desired treatment with their respective physician/ dentist; a site that will combine 'social-networking' and donations features together. The second program is a collaboration site for dentists who know each other in a given region and represent different specialties. In this site, these expert members can form small forums providing online collaboration with a preselected patient who needs multidisciplinary care. The forum members will also be able to collaborate together, post cases, discuss techniques, etc. Both sites will also feature directory of providers with videos about the doctors, their practices, along with testimonials.

I am interested to attend the conference to gain more understanding of current technologies and collaborate with other and learn about their experience as well as look for developers who can help build such sites.</description>

    <description>SwiftMD transforms healthcare by providing emergency physicians, psychiatrists, orthopedic surgeons and other services in real time, 24/7, as well as an intelligent EHR that empowers our members with the knowledge of doctors for common problems.

Healthcare is ridden by traditions, driven by reimbursement schedules, and inconvenient for all involved. The future of health care is virtual, and virtually unlimited for those who embrace change. Many patients will become informed consumers, rather than passive dependents. With bi-directional video, computer assisted diagnosis, and point of care technology, more and more the exam room will be located where patients are, in the workplace, the home, retail centers, in transit, on vacation.

For its members, SwiftMD liberates healthcare from &#8220;brick and mortar&#8221; and supports life without Managed Care and Medicare. We restore intelligence and access to a system warped by reimbursement fees and defensive medicine. SwiftMD-Great doctors, right now, accessible by internet, videophone, or telephone.

    <description>(Note:  Would like to be part of &quot;Lunch and Launch&quot; session in October (as communicated to Matthew Holt on a visit to SF June 1).  Site will be ready be end of summer and tested in school in Fall. BodiMojo.com, currently in R&amp;D, will be an online teen health destination bridging rich health content; teen generated content, social networking, and mobile applications.  The goal:  to motivate and incentivise teens to make healthy choices.   Mojo - one's magic, charm, presence &#8211; includes taking the best care of oneself in the context of youth culture and demands.

While grant funding focuses primarily on obesity prevention - nutrition, physical activity and body image concerns among youth, the site will also focus on typical teen risk behaviors - the reasons teens go online for health information, i.e., sexual health, substance use and stress/depression.  BodiMojo fills a gap in the online marketplace between online health destinations primarily geared to adults and youth oriented social networks that rarely focus on health as part of identity.  BodiMojo will offer customized health assessments with tailored feedback, email/sms reminder system based on health goals, wireless pedometer readings, content (user generated and expert delivered) and interactive tools tagged for individual teens base on health data and site activity.  User activity will result in point reward system eventually translating into a virtual economy.

    <description>We are establishing a volunteer-powered, primary care health clinic that will serve the uninsured in San Francisco and San Mateo County.  We are based upon a successful national model called Volunteers in Medicine (www.volunteersinmedicine.org).  VIM was started in 1992 by Dr. Jack McConnell in Hilton Head, SC; there are now 73 VIM clinics throughout the country.  Unique to VIM is the use of an often untapped community resource -- retired physicians, nurses and others to provide compassionate care, free-of-charge, to the uninsured in their own community.  Additionally unique is the commitment to practice medicine without the administrative burdens of public or private health insurance, allowing healthcare providers to practice &quot;the art of medicine&quot; rather than the &quot;business of healthcare.&quot;  Our clinic, called Clinic by the Bay, will be based in the Excelsior district of SF, a Medically Underserved Area with few social service providers.  We are committed to utilizing EMR and other technologies to create a state-of-the-art clinic for the underserved.  We have an unparalleled opportunity at this particular time in history to start a community clinic from scratch that is truly a clinic of the future -- marrying &quot;old-fashioned&quot; medicine with modern technology -- improving patient engagement and health outcomes.</description>

The Children&#8217;s Rare Disease Network will create greater public awareness for rare disease, while connecting, educating and empowering the millions of families and caregivers affected, through an online community and collaborative portal.

1 in 10 Americans affected by rare disease.  1 in 30 Children are affected.   There are over 7,000 Identified Rare Diseases with over 25 million people in the US affected - 30 Million in the European Union.

We are building a collaborative portal that will connect these families, caregivers and rare disease stakeholders.   We are a true Health 2.0 organization!

    <description>We are a privately held company based in Sierra Madre California. Our company is focused on developing, managing, and operating customized wound care and hyperbaric out-patient programs and services for hospital partners.

We utilize technology to reduce the cost of traditional wound programs, allowing hospitals to generate revenue and meet the needs of a growing population of patients. 
Paramount to our philosophy of partnership is our dedication to innovation.

WCA has developed several exciting proprietary tools, including the first video-telemedicine tool designed specifically for wound care and hyperbaric medicine. 

Our program management dashboard, e-wound and our Electronic Medical Record System allows for total control over the operation of each WCA program and lets all stakeholders in a hospital know exactly where every aspect of their program stands in comparison to budget, goals, and objectives at any time.

    <description>As a PhD in medical anthropology, I am working on a project at Duke to develop a computer platform that enables learners to experience a virtual patient interaction as a way of learning cultural competency, teamwork and safety in a reproducible and cost effective way.  A software company is partnering with us to develop the platform.  Cases that will be developed will cover a wide range of both patients and medical conditions.  

Additionally, I train physicians, residents, medical students and other clinical and non clinical staff in cultural competency, patient safety, and teamwork.  In this role, I am experimenting with a variety of interactive online tools and strategies.  

I would be thrilled to learn more about what is possible, what others are experimenting with,what is proving impactful.

I would greatly appreciate your support!

    <description>Patagon Health (formed in California as Patagon Systems, LLC) will be focused on tools and services to help the consolidation of medical groups into Accountable Care Organizations. There are 160,000 medical groups in the US today, far too many to enable any kind of meaninful standardization of care. As a result, variation in cost is more than 2.5X between regions without any appreciable difference in health status outcomes. There are numerous ideas to pursue besides straight-up management consulting. The business will start in the services realm and develop specific product concepts in time. The product concepts will likely be in the modelling and simulation realm (financial, clinical) to help providers, payers and patients make better decisions about their organizations and their care.</description>

One, why go half way around the world, a different hemisphere, a different time zone, and a potentially dangerous part of the world.  We will be performing state of the art surgeries in the Dominican Republic.  When you think of &quot;Medical Tourism&quot; the island of the Dominican Republic is ideal. Not Mumbai.  Two, we have perfected a surgery that cures Type II Diabetes. Its a deviation of the bariatric surgery but we have been successful in Curing diabetes.  Some medical professionals say this is because of the eventual weight loss. Well, this is not the case as the patients we operate on are cured from one day to the next.  We believe this is a great opportunity since there are over 100 million people with type II diabetes in the Americas (North, Central, and South).

We have developed a web application that allows health clinics to build their own brochures on our site - they can manage their prices, staff information, pictures, upload videos and respond to patient enquiries and reviews from their own console.

Run by doctors we aim to help the patient make an informed decision on their treatment and we plan to monetize the site from lead generation, listing fees, banner advertising, and sponsored pages.</description>

    <description>On february 1st, I founded two companies to provide and facilitate online services in the field of healthcare. The first is Dutch and called zorghelden.net (translates to heroes of care) and is a healthcare cooperative society. With a Dutch university hospital I aim to develop a full online coach program to help people that suffer from heart disease and diabetes to set and achieve health goals through integrated care coordinated by the coach. The patient side of the website will be 'social' where users can form groups, invite people to their group, stimulate each other with health challenges, exchange experiences they had with coaches, earn points for goals achieved as a group that can be spend online and offline.  On the careprovider side of the website, the online coach program offers the possibility to people with sufficient medical education to participate and enroll as a member of the coorporation, follow training, adopt a standard of care and offer their services to users of the website. Services are paid for by a Dutch healthcare insurer based upon success rate and user satisfaction with the coach. With this initiative I hope to help reduce the demand for care by making the participation in own healthcare fun. Also I hope to help to improve the delivery of integrated care to the user while reducing the (ginourmous upcoming) shortage of careproviders by enabling those who are not active in the medical field today to enroll as a coach.

The second is called healthiez.com (pronounce health ease) which is a platform (full open API) to log personal health outcomes (medication intake, blood pressure, blood glucose, pain, sleep, mood etc) by synchronizing medical applications from a smartphone as well as outcomes from health devices, (bio) sensors and smart medication sensors (all data send via the smartphone). I aim to develop a service to interpret those outcomes through algorithms and correltations into simple graphs and health ratings (from which no medical conclusions should be drawn unless originating from objective monitoring via e.g. sensors, devices connected to the internet). The community discusses health issues related to the things users try to improve, compare scores with other users, give each other challenges to improve and exchange tips.  </description>

    <description>Portable Genomics is developing software solutions for the deciphering and visualization of full genome data on portable devices. We are initiating the connection of genomic medicine and wireless healthcare.

Our solution will provide patients a better understanding of the clinical importance of their genomic data and will allow accordingly, their connection to healthcare, pharmaceutical, agro-food and wellness providers.

We shall provide a prototype by summer 2010 that will run onto the Apple iPhone/iPad and will allow the visualization of a reduced set of genetic markers. At that time the company will be incorporated, and will have applied for fundings to finance one additional year of development. The final product will be delivered during summer 2011.

Bringing wireless connectivity to genomic data is quite new and offer a large set of innovative perspectives in the practice of personalized medicine. 

It is anticipated that customers may face ambiguous or alarming results that will need expert interpretation. Portable Genomics will provide connection to the closest healthcare providers to obtain recommendation and guidance. More basic and good-sense informations provided by genomic data will allow connection to the food industry professionals and wellness providers for a personalized and participative health care.

    <description>ihealthUS provides individuals with the information and tools to track, manage and plan healthcare costs and avoid unplanned expenditure.

An average US family will spend $6,500 in 2010 in out-of-pocket costs and plan contributions on healthcare compared to $4,500 in 2007. An estimated 8-10% ($500) saving per member can be achieved by improving access to healthcare cost information, facilitating timely reimbursements and appeals, identifying lower cost options for prescriptions &amp; care. Problems faced by high deductible &amp; reimbursement based health plan members:

- Complexity: Higher deductibles &amp; co-pays require self-management of information from insurers, Health Savings &amp; Reimbursement Accounts and providers.
- Appeals: 1 in 7 claims are denied resulting in higher cost contribution from individual with no information and tools to help with filing and tracking appeals.
- Reimbursements: 50% of plans require reimbursement from HSA/HRA accounts. Need to track and file timely reimbursements and identify covered expenses.

The system is facilitative, i.e. doctors have a choice over the content, and is thereby doctor-specific, patient-specific and procedure-specific, meeting many of the challenges in taking good and fully informed consent

There is a portal for the patient user to communicate online with the doctor, and to access the consent record, see FAQ's, post comments etc..

This record can be used as a yardstick of good ethical care and as a marker of transparency in the doctor-patient relationship.  The informed patient is an empowered patient.Health Care organization, using Health 2.0 technology as a customerHealth 2.0 technology company providing technology or services to consumers or businessesMartin Young is an ENT surgeon in full time private practice, but with a sessional appointment to the local state hospital service.

    <description>In an attempt to skate to where the puck will be -- rather than where it is today -- we are working with payers and providers to facilitate the new models of care, such as ACOs and Medical Homes, that are around the corner. We are developing a platform to link patients, providers, and payers to facilitate a range of healthcare conversations that can prevent unnecessary visits (e.g., emergency room visits, inpatient admissions), replace in-person visits with virtual ones, and promote practice and behavior changes -- for better outcomes at reduced cost.  Health 2.0 technology company providing technology or services to consumers or businessesI recently moved to Albuquerque from Boston where I was a senior executive in healthcare technology.  I spent the last 12 years in healthcare IT innovation. Until recently I drove the innovation strategy at the Healthcare division of Nuance Communications.   Prior to that I founded a successful venture in speech recognition in medical documentation that I sold to Nuance. 
 
Now along with Henry Chueh, MD, MS (Chief, Division of Biomedical Informatics at MGH), Jacob Reider, MD (Chief Medical Informatics Officer at Allscripts) and Harjinder Sandhu, PhD (Healthcare Entrepreneur and formerly Chief Technologist at Nuance), I am working on a new venture.

    <description>I propose that you use me as a keynote introductory speaker for your Washington, DC Conference [I live 35 miles away]

My book, &#8220;The Future of Medicine &#8211; Megatrends in Healthcare,&#8221; was written based on interviews with over 150 leaders from across the country on what to expect as advances in medicine in the coming five to fifteen years. Since its publication I have done the research for a sequel, also interviewing over 150 individuals [doctors, nurses, hospital executives, insurance company leaders, health care consultants, etc] to gauge what the delivery of medical care and the hospital of the future will be like in the coming years. 

Combined, this information would make a compelling 20-30 minute background/setting talk for your conference. 

I will be happy to send you a copy of &#8220;The Future of Medicine &#8211; Megatrends in Healthcare&#8221; along with a very short DVD that introduces the topic in return for an address. No obligation provided that you do not complain that I chose to spell healthcare as one word for the title.

Meanwhile you can get an overview at www.medicalmegatrends.com 
Stephen C. Schimpff, MD is the retired Chief Executive Officer of the University of Maryland Medical Center and author of &#8220;The Future of Medicine &#8211; Megatrends in Healthcare.&#8221; It discusses the scientific advances in medicine such as genomics, stem cells, vaccines, medical devices, imaging, the operating room and information management. He is writing a sequel on the &#8220;hospital of the future&#8221; and the changes coming in the delivery of medical care. The book demonstrates how physicians and hospitals must and will change to accommodate. It addresses how healthcare reform will impact the delivery of medical care into the future (http://medicalmegatrends.blogspot.com ). Dr Schimpff also teamed with Dr Morton Rapoport to write &#8220;Alignment &#8211; The Key to Success of the University of Maryland Medical System.&#8221; It describes the 25 years since the University of Maryland Hospital was separated from state ownership and university governance and grew from a struggling single hospital to a very successful nine hospital system.

Dr. Schimpff, an Eagle Scout, graduated from Rutgers University and Yale Medical School where he also did his internal medicine residency. He then completed medical oncology and infectious diseases fellowships. He is Board certified in Internal Medicine, Medical Oncology and Infectious Diseases.

Dr. Schimpff was at the National Cancer Institute for 13 years caring for patients with acute leukemia and lymphomas and conducting research into the serious infections that occur in these patients. He was appointed a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland Medical School where he was head of Infectious Diseases and director of the University of Maryland Cancer Center. In 1985 he became Chief Operating Officer of the University of Maryland Medical System and in 1999 the CEO of the flagship University of Maryland Medical Center. He is also a professor in the University of Maryland School Of Public Policy.

Dr. Schimpff was chair of the Board of Governors of the National Institutes of Health&#8217;s Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center from January 1999 until 2003; he was a board member since its inception in 1996.  

Dr Schimpff gives frequent lectures on the future of medicine and healthcare delivery. He  is a consultant to the United States Army, Battelle Memorial Institute, Booz Allen Hamilton and is on the board of directors or the scientific advisory board of four developing medical device or information systems companies. He recently served on a Congressionally-mandated panel to examine whether the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the Fort Belvoir Army Medical Center would be &#8220;world class&#8221; when completed in 2011.
