3banana,http:3banana.com,"Health 2.0 Makes Information Therapy PossibleHealth 2.0 for the first time makes Information Therapy practical and possible. Health 2.0 is about individuals creating and sharing more of themselves online in a way that improves their own health, the health of others they are connected to, and the health of the community as a whole. Information therapy is based on the idea that what we think and believe -- the content of our minds -- can influence our health, either directly or through our behavior, and that we can change and influence the content of our minds and therefore also our health through information media. Personalized health, however, is infinitely diverse, and if we had to design the right information therapy for the right person at the right time, we would never finish the job. So how does Health 2.0 make information therapy possible? The needs in health care are so diverse, so complex, so personalized, and so rapidly changing, that information therapy derived from a scripted template cannot fully address the diversity of needs. Without Health 2.0, the greater the number and diversity of people with health needs, the more infinitely complex the situation becomes. Health 2.0, on the other hand, changes the information therapy equation. Because the participants also are co-creators, selectors, navigators, recommenders, and reviewers of content, the more people involved the greater their diversity, the more possible it is to meet everyone’s needs. While some traditionalists might argue about evidence-based information, the reality is that rich and diverse Health 2.0 communities are also enabling an acceleration of evidence gathering and controlled research to generate new knowledge about how information therapy works and what works for whom, so that we may truly learn how the right information can be given to the right person at the right time to improve health.",,false,,,"undergrad-edu:

Administered by a national program office at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Project HealthDesign’s goal is to design and test a suite of PHR tools and applications that work together to help people achieve their various and specific health goals in an integrated fashion. The program is supported by the Foundation’s Pioneer Portfolio, which funds innovative projects that can lead to fundamental breakthroughs in the health and health care of all Americans.This bold new program will build on and extend the range of uses offered by existing PHRs by supporting multidisciplinary teams to design and test a broad spectrum of innovations in how consumers can use information technology to better manage their health and more easily navigate the health care system. Project HealthDesign challenges health experts and technology designers to push the envelope in thinking about the transformative potential of PHRs and design PHR systems that can exist on a common platform.In this two-phased, 18-month initiative, nine design teams will participate in a six-month structured process to create user-centered personal health applications that address specific health challenges faced by individuals and families. In the subsequent 12-month prototype phase, these personal health applications will be tested in target populations.The program’s objectives are to:*Develop innovative designs for PHR products and services that can help individuals and their families manage important health challenges",,false,,,"undergrad-edu:

4p technologies,www.4ptechnologies.com,"We have implemented in Santa Clara county a location-based, mobile application that will provide patients, who need an urgent care visit, information about the next available appointment at their PCP......s office or at the local urgent care center.  This application can proactively divert avoidable ER visits to either urgent care centers or PCP offices, saving costs and providing higher quality care.  If the patient feels these times are not fast enough, they can use the app to forward clinical information in a continuing care document to a participating ER.  When they get to the ER, the location-based technology will identify them and the app will push to the ER physician, the patient's pharmacy, laboratory, radiology and current problem list.  Even if the patient does not activate the app on the way to the ER, the technology will sense real-time that the patient is in a participating ER and the medical management team can reach out to the patient the following morning to reconnect them to their PCP, thus reducing multiple visits to the ER.  This also provides the medical group a seamless, simple method to identify practices that are making the extra effort to accommodate urgent care visits and thus, can be used to bonus these practices.  Bonusing practices for accommodating urgent care visits provides a pathway toward greater adoption of advanced access (same day PCP visits).",,false,,,"undergrad-edu:

The essential idea is based on the observation that better search brings better efficiencies to markets.At the moment, a common complaint among many health care seekers is their inability to find a good doctor.  I have performed some research which gives a bit more context to this observation, but the overall focus of the company is to provide *one* place where a health care consumer could find healthcare providers, including physicians (of course), but also chiropractors, nutritionists, psychologists, nurse practitioners, acupuncturists, off-shore medical centers (for medical vacations), and so on.Starting with this set of data, and a relentless focus on usability and ease of use, I believe we can provide a service that no one is focused on providing.  Competitors are usually focused on selling other services into their physician search sites.

Culture of Health Organization,www.cultureofhealth.org,"COHO's mission is to define, measure and promote a culture of health in the home, workplace and community.  While personal health is an altruistic societal goal, other than smoking cessation, there is little other behavior change (of a personal, commercial or community nature) that has risen to the level of becoming part of our culture.  And when a movement becomes enculturated, powerful forces are unleashed that can do more than any policy or program - whether private or governmental - ever could.  Therein lay the vision for the Culture of Health Organization.The most significant missing element to transform health from an ideal to a movement is leadership; leadership on a family unit basis, in the workplace and on a community/governmental level.  To address this deficit, we are building a founding board of advisers who will bring leadership credentials from the world of consumer engagement, business, and community activism/government.  These individuals will contribute their expertise and guidance gleaned from the fields of consumer marketing, social anthropology/culture development and public policy development let alone health and health care.As the organization grows, we will be open to all contributors and collaborators with the intent of pulling in otherwise competing commercial entities (e.g., health plans, consultants/brokers, pharma) and related non-profits (e.g., APHA, NBGH, PBGH, IBI) in a way that makes it worth their while to participate with COHO rather than going it alone.The seminal event for COHO will be its inaugural conference slated for Q4'08 or Q1'09.  From that point forward, COHO will be a self-sustaining non-profit with revenues derived from:-- annual membership (organizational entity memberships and organizations sponsoring individuals; i.e., an employer sponsoring each of their employees for $1 per year)-- benchmarking / data-- Culture of Health certification and ongoing royalties-- Royalties from ""Healthy Reality"" - a technology/service incubator combined with a TV reality module embedded in an existing TV show (e.g., Oprah, Rachel Ray, Today, Discovery Channel, The Food Network).Clearly Health 2.0 is focused on the supply side of this critically important transformation in health and health care.  With the exception of Health Reality (see above), COHO will be more about the demand side of the equation.  Consequently, I see our two organizations as highly synergistic.",,false,,,"undergrad-edu:

These twin peaks create misunderstanding, missed opportunity, excessive diagnostics, wasted care and inferior outcomes.  We provide web-based platforms to help patients and providers solve these problems to improve outcomes and decrease costs.We have 'pre-loaded' our platforms for musculoskeletal conditions (back pain, arthritis, carpal tunnel, etc.) based on their prevalence, fit with what we offer and unmet need.Specifically, our tools do 4 things...1.  Facilitate good, cost-effective conversations.Evidence based decision support for doctors and patients.    After Visit Summaries.  Pre and Post-Op instructions.  Health Gateway allows providers to create customized treatment plans for patients and then monitor and support patient compliance and outcomes.

The forum members will also be able to collaborate together, post cases, discuss techniques, etc. Both sites will also feature directory of providers with videos about the doctors, their practices, along with testimonials.I am interested to attend the conference to gain more understanding of current technologies and collaborate with other and learn about their experience as well as look for developers who can help build such sites.",,false,,,"undergrad-edu:

BodiMojo fills a gap in the online marketplace between online health destinations primarily geared to adults and youth oriented social networks that rarely focus on health as part of identity.  BodiMojo will offer customized health assessments with tailored feedback, email/sms reminder system based on health goals, wireless pedometer readings, content (user generated and expert delivered) and interactive tools tagged for individual teens base on health data and site activity.

Clinic by the Bay,www.clinicbythebay.org,"We are establishing a volunteer-powered, primary care health clinic that will serve the uninsured in San Francisco and San Mateo County.  We are based upon a successful national model called Volunteers in Medicine (www.volunteersinmedicine.org).  VIM was started in 1992 by Dr. Jack McConnell in Hilton Head, SC; there are now 73 VIM clinics throughout the country.  Unique to VIM is the use of an often untapped community resource -- retired physicians, nurses and others to provide compassionate care, free-of-charge, to the uninsured in their own community.  Additionally unique is the commitment to practice medicine without the administrative burdens of public or private health insurance, allowing healthcare providers to practice ""the art of medicine"" rather than the ""business of healthcare.""  Our clinic, called Clinic by the Bay, will be based in the Excelsior district of SF, a Medically Underserved Area with few social service providers.  We are committed to utilizing EMR and other technologies to create a state-of-the-art clinic for the underserved.  We have an unparalleled opportunity at this particular time in history to start a community clinic from scratch that is truly a clinic of the future -- marrying ""old-fashioned"" medicine with modern technology -- improving patient engagement and health outcomes.",,false,,,"undergrad-edu:

Right Way Medical Tourism,,"We are focusing on medical tourism for the Americas.  Right now India has the market and the supply for medical tourism.  We have a couple of compelling arguments. One, why go half way around the world, a different hemisphere, a different time zone, and a potentially dangerous part of the world.  We will be performing state of the art surgeries in the Dominican Republic.  When you think of ""Medical Tourism"" the island of the Dominican Republic is ideal. Not Mumbai.  Two, we have perfected a surgery that cures Type II Diabetes. Its a deviation of the bariatric surgery but we have been successful in Curing diabetes.  Some medical professionals say this is because of the eventual weight loss. Well, this is not the case as the patients we operate on are cured from one day to the next.  We believe this is a great opportunity since there are over 100 million people with type II diabetes in the Americas (North, Central, and South).

zorgheldennet and goudenbezitnl,,"On february 1st, I founded two companies to provide and facilitate online services in the field of healthcare. The first is Dutch and called zorghelden.net (translates to heroes of care) and is a healthcare cooperative society. With a Dutch university hospital I aim to develop a full online coach program to help people that suffer from heart disease and diabetes to set and achieve health goals through integrated care coordinated by the coach. The patient side of the website will be 'social' where users can form groups, invite people to their group, stimulate each other with health challenges, exchange experiences they had with coaches, earn points for goals achieved as a group that can be spend online and offline.  On the careprovider side of the website, the online coach program offers the possibility to people with sufficient medical education to participate and enroll as a member of the coorporation, follow training, adopt a standard of care and offer their services to users of the website. Services are paid for by a Dutch healthcare insurer based upon success rate and user satisfaction with the coach. With this initiative I hope to help reduce the demand for care by making the participation in own healthcare fun. Also I hope to help to improve the delivery of integrated care to the user while reducing the (ginourmous upcoming) shortage of careproviders by enabling those who are not active in the medical field today to enroll as a coach.The second is called healthiez.com (pronounce health ease) which is a platform (full open API) to log personal health outcomes (medication intake, blood pressure, blood glucose, pain, sleep, mood etc) by synchronizing medical applications from a smartphone as well as outcomes from health devices, (bio) sensors and smart medication sensors (all data send via the smartphone). I aim to develop a service to interpret those outcomes through algorithms and correltations into simple graphs and health ratings (from which no medical conclusions should be drawn unless originating from objective monitoring via e.g. sensors, devices connected to the internet). The community discusses health issues related to the things users try to improve, compare scores with other users, give each other challenges to improve and exchange tips.

Retired CEO University of Maryland Medical Center,http:www.medicalmegatrends.com,"I propose that you use me as a keynote introductory speaker for your Washington, DC Conference [I live 35 miles away]My book, “The Future of Medicine – Megatrends in Healthcare,” was written based on interviews with over 150 leaders from across the country on what to expect as advances in medicine in the coming five to fifteen years. Since its publication I have done the research for a sequel, also interviewing over 150 individuals [doctors, nurses, hospital executives, insurance company leaders, health care consultants, etc] to gauge what the delivery of medical care and the hospital of the future will be like in the coming years.Combined, this information would make a compelling 20-30 minute background/setting talk for your conference.I will be happy to send you a copy of “The Future of Medicine – Megatrends in Healthcare” along with a very short DVD that introduces the topic in return for an address. No obligation provided that you do not complain that I chose to spell healthcare as one word for the title.Meanwhile you can get an overview at www.medicalmegatrends.comStephen C. Schimpff, MD is the retired Chief Executive Officer of the University of Maryland Medical Center and author of “The Future of Medicine – Megatrends in Healthcare.” It discusses the scientific advances in medicine such as genomics, stem cells, vaccines, medical devices, imaging, the operating room and information management. He is writing a sequel on the “hospital of the future” and the changes coming in the delivery of medical care. The book demonstrates how physicians and hospitals must and will change to accommodate. It addresses how healthcare reform will impact the delivery of medical care into the future (http://medicalmegatrends.blogspot.com ). Dr Schimpff also teamed with Dr Morton Rapoport to write “Alignment – The Key to Success of the University of Maryland Medical System.” It describes the 25 years since the University of Maryland Hospital was separated from state ownership and university governance and grew from a struggling single hospital to a very successful nine hospital system.Dr. Schimpff, an Eagle Scout, graduated from Rutgers University and Yale Medical School where he also did his internal medicine residency. He then completed medical oncology and infectious diseases fellowships. He is Board certified in Internal Medicine, Medical Oncology and Infectious Diseases.Dr. Schimpff was at the National Cancer Institute for 13 years caring for patients with acute leukemia and lymphomas and conducting research into the serious infections that occur in these patients. He was appointed a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland Medical School where he was head of Infectious Diseases and director of the University of Maryland Cancer Center. In 1985 he became Chief Operating Officer of the University of Maryland Medical System and in 1999 the CEO of the flagship University of Maryland Medical Center. He is also a professor in the University of Maryland School Of Public Policy.Dr. Schimpff was chair of the Board of Governors of the National Institutes of Health’s Warren G.
