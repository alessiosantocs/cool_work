73,alan ,kittner,,,,alan.alankittner.com,5106443017,,For the last fix months I have been incubating an idea for a company focused on the care-giver market for seniors who want to continue living independently.  

Once (and only if) I clarify the business model I commit myself full time to the venture. The idea is based on a variety of web 2.0 business models that presently exist, although I haven't validated them for my idea, to date.

I would like to attend the conference for no cost or at a greatly reduced rate given that I am just starting a consulting business to support myself as I pursue this new business opportunity.

If I can be helpful at the conference - either as a speaker or otherwise - I would be more than happy to do so.

Thanks in advance.
