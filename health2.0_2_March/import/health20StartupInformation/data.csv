This makes all stakeholders accountable for value returned, as opposed to the current system which has no accountability for results. We contract with self-insured employers who bear the direct burden of medical costs – and so have the most to gain through cost control. By helping them structure their benefits to reward employees for health improvement, we motivate people to become very engaged. 
 
Individual screenings and health risk assessments allow us to accurately score individual health risk, and then tailor a personal health management program for each individual. When members make measurable improvements in their scores, they receive incentive payments. 
 
Physicians control the health care programs – their role is vital to success. We assemble a panel of physicians for each employee group. Most of these physicians will already be in the employer’s existing network. Our program gives these physicians tools, information, and resources that reduce their administrative and clinical expense while increasing their revenue. Plus, when member health improves, the physicians receive incentive payments as well. 
 
Physicians care for the members, while Truu Health provides resources that help coach the members when they are away from the clinic. It’s a partnership that works. As our technology moves real-time information among physicians, patients and health coaches, we adjust health targets and interventions, and we track and measure outcomes. The result is a healthier workforce, and that means lower cost and higher productivity – a powerful competitive advantage for the employer.

The essential idea is based on the observation that better search brings better efficiencies to markets.  

At the moment, a common complaint among many health care seekers is their inability to find a good doctor.  I have performed some research which gives a bit more context to this observation, but the overall focus of the company is to provide *one* place where a health care consumer could find healthcare providers, including physicians (of course), but also chiropractors, nutritionists, psychologists, nurse practitioners, acupuncturists, off-shore medical centers (for medical vacations), and so on.  

Starting with this set of data, and a relentless focus on usability and ease of use, I believe we can provide a service that no one is focused on providing.  Competitors are usually focused on selling other services into their physician search sites.  I believe this limits their effectiveness and trustworthiness. 

It is my belief that a site with a single focus and doing one thing well will resonate with users and ultimately be successful.","","","","","","","Please treat this information as highly confidential.

Consumers use www.outofpocket.com to help them make informed decisions before purchasing routine health care services.  

The OutofPocket.com directory contains prices collected from several different sources including:

-- Consumer Generated Content: Consumers anonymously post prices they paid for routine health care services, (including MRIs, mammograms, X-rays, lab tests, vaccinations, dental, vision and office visits), along with their personal recommendations on the provider 

A soft release of the website was launched in July 2007 and we are currently working on the next release of the site, and hope to have it launched by year end.  

-- Providers that Disclose Pricing: Providers are invited to submit true prices for their services for inclusion in the directory

This unique combination of interfacing, communications and device integration is called EXTENSION®.

As a reseller of Cisco Advanced Unified Communications and various medical applications, it has been a appropriate fit that we develop this software.  We have years of experience in technical and clinical implementation.  Our experiences in the healthcare setting have made us realize the disparity of data between applications, understand the time involved in implementing a 1:1 interface, and see firsthand the workarounds that hospitals and other large healthcare groups use to accommodate each other.

Vocera’s hands-free, wireless solution provides a cost-effective, easy-to-use system for instant voice communication in hospitals, hotels, retail, and other building and campus environments. The Vocera Communications System consists of two key components: the Vocera System Software that controls and manages call activity, and the Vocera Communications Badge B2000, a lightweight, voice-controlled communication device that allows users to converse over a wireless LAN (802.11b/g). 

Vocera System Software provides centralized system intelligence, including: call-flow management, user manager, and connection manager programs as well as the Nuance speech recognition software and various databases.

The Vocera Communications Badge is controlled using natural, spoken commands. To initiate a conversation with Jim and Mary, for example, the user would simply say, “Conference Jim Anderson and Mary Garman.” In addition, when a live conversation is not necessary, text messages and alerts can be sent to the high-contrast OLED display on the back of the Vocera Communications Badge B2000. The exterior surfaces of the Vocera Communications Badge B2000 incorporates a silver-ion technology from BioCote® which inhibits the growth of bacteria, fungus, and algae.

Together, the Vocera System Software and Badge allow users to instantly communicate with others throughout a building or campus environment. Optional Vocera Telephony Solution Software enables users to make and receive telephone calls directly from their Badge through the PBX. 

The Vocera Communications solution is ideal for healthcare environments where patient satisfaction depend on the high availability of clinical staff. Vocera is a proven solution that connects people instantly, creating highly satisfied staff and patients.

","Vocera has raised $53 million in five rounds of funding through a mix of venture capital firms and corporate investors, including Avalon Ventures, Cisco Systems, Inc., Granite Global Ventures, IDEO, Intel Communications Fund, RRE Ventures, Motorola Ventures, Thomas Weisel Venture Partners, Vanguard Ventures, and Venrock Associates. ","At this time, Vocera is not planning to seek additional funding. This funding will carry Vocera to the point where it is cash flow positive.

Vocera had a record year in 2007 in terms of new customers, orders, and revenue. The new customer base continues to grow rapidly across numerous vertical markets, while the installed customer base continues to expand their use of Vocera — both very strong indicators for Vocera’s continued success. As of the beginning of 2008, Vocera has over 500 full-scale installations in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Primary growth continues to come from healthcare institutions worldwide.

","As a private company, Vocera prefers not to release revenue information to the public. ","The founders of Vocera recruited me to the company over six years ago. As the first marketing and business development staff member, I lead market and product research to ensure we were providing the right product for our target audience: healthcare. In this time, I have held numerous positions, most recently, Executive Vice President. I was promoted to president and chief operating officer in January 2008.
	
Before joining Vocera, I worked at 3Com Corporation, where I co founded the Home Networking Division and spearheaded rapid growth for the organization’s Fast Ethernet Network Interface Card business.

"29","Mark","Agnew","Executive Director","Culture of Health Organization","www.cultureofhealth.org","mark.agnew@cultureofhealth.org","6507999246","","COHO's mission is to define, measure and promote a culture of health in the home, workplace and community.  While personal health is an altruistic societal goal, other than smoking cessation, there is little other behavior change (of a personal, commercial or community nature) that has risen to the level of becoming part of our culture.  And when a movement becomes enculturated, powerful forces are unleashed that can do more than any policy or program - whether private or governmental - ever could.  Therein lay the vision for the Culture of Health Organization.

The most significant missing element to transform health from an ideal to a movement is leadership; leadership on a family unit basis, in the workplace and on a community/governmental level.  To address this deficit, we are building a founding board of advisers who will bring leadership credentials from the world of consumer engagement, business, and community activism/government.  These individuals will contribute their expertise and guidance gleaned from the fields of consumer marketing, social anthropology/culture development and public policy development let alone health and health care.

As the organization grows, we will be open to all contributors and collaborators with the intent of pulling in otherwise competing commercial entities (e.g., health plans, consultants/brokers, pharma) and related non-profits (e.g., APHA, NBGH, PBGH, IBI) in a way that makes it worth their while to participate with COHO rather than going it alone.

The seminal event for COHO will be its inaugural conference slated for Q4'08 or Q1'09.  From that point forward, COHO will be a self-sustaining non-profit with revenues derived from:
-- annual membership (organizational entity memberships and organizations sponsoring individuals; i.e., an employer sponsoring each of their employees for $1 per year)
-- benchmarking / data
-- Culture of Health certification and ongoing royalties
-- Royalties from ""Healthy Reality"" - a technology/service incubator combined with a TV reality module embedded in an existing TV show (e.g., Oprah, Rachel Ray, Today, Discovery Channel, The Food Network).

Clearly Health 2.0 is focused on the supply side of this critically important transformation in health and health care.  With the exception of Health Reality (see above), COHO will be more about the demand side of the equation.  Consequently, I see our two organizations as highly synergistic.","","","","","","","Please treat this information as highly confidential.

I've always been a fan and would love to contribute in some way.   

Perhaps there could be a research arm of Health 2.0?  
Because research and feedback are such a crucial part of medicine (even if we don't always practice what the research says), Health 2.0 may want some kind of research component to it.  If, as Health2.0ers, we work so that anyone could take over some of the information and lifestyle management tasks for their health, we should similarly be providing the research structure required by these activities.  There's probably an ethical argument too, and there are precedents in other internet domains, it could be like Verisign.

PictureRx makes taking medications easy. Users can use our online tools to generate picture-based medication instructions, learn more about the medications they are taking, set reminders, ask other users questions about their therapy, automatically refill their prescriptions, comparison shop for medications and 
much more! All through an easy-to-use interface designed for patients and caregivers alike. In the process, users stay healthy and save money. 

PictureRx’s core, patent-pending technology has been shown in a federally-funded, randomized controlled trial to increase adherence and leave patients more satisfied. PictureRx is poised to bring these results to the marketplace. 

02.  The Need 
Almost 50% of prescriptions are taken incorrectly and persistence to long-term therapy is less than half of what it should. Prescription drug noncompliance has enormous health consequences for patients and financial consequences for payors, pharmacies, and manufacturers valued at $100-$300 billion annually. 
Despite the growing number of users going online for health information, online tools for medication management are limited and are narrow in scope. PictureRx is designed to be the most comprehensive place on the internet for medication management. 

03.  Market Trends 
PictureRx comes to the market at the right time. Important trends we take advantage of include: 
• An aging population taking more medications 
• More people turning online for health information 
• Increasing caregiver fatigue 
• Growth in use of online personal health records 

04.  Our Strategy 
PictureRx isn’t intended to replace personal health records, it’s to make them better. We plan to “play well” with others and deploy our technology for managing medications in various forms across the web and in stores.  We’re starting by implementing our flagship site, MyPictureRx.com, as a way to build a 
loyal group of users.  Ultimately we plan to white-label our product for insurance companies, retail pharmacies, and online personal health records. 

05.  Monetization 
PictureRx will make money in at least 3 ways. First, PictureRx will charge users a subscription fee. Second, it will negotiate revenue sharing deals with retail pharmacies in exchange for driving business. Third, PictureRx will white-label our product for use by payors, providers and pharmacies. 

06.  The Team 
PictureRx’s team includes experienced entrepreneurs, healthcare professionals and software developers: a practicing physician and entrepreneur, founders and executives of a successful software development company, and one of the nation’s top researchers on medication adherence and health literacy.

SugarStats' completely web-based self-management interface tracks, monitors and accesses glucose levels, important diabetes statistics and graphs to spot dangerous trends and better manage diabetic health.  SugarStats is free, deriving the majority of its revenue from advertisers.

SugarStats was developed by a diabetic to lower risk of serious complications such as blindness and amputations through better and easier online diabetes self-management. To date, users have reported improvements that are reducing risks of serious complications by as much as 10-80%. Launched in beta pilot just one year ago, SugarStats has already successfully achieved a number of significant milestones including over 4000 users in 24 countries without formal advertising or marketing, 10-15% monthly growth, and has received recognition as “Best Diabetes Management Site Online” in 2007 and 2008 within the Health 2.0 field.

Now we're evolving, expanding and building a solid platform for not only the individual diabetic, but PHR/Health 2.0 Companies and HMO's as well as hospitals/clinics, insurance companies and Endocrinologists/doctors with diabetic patients.

The Internet has become consumers' primary source for health information, but their doctor remains their most trusted resource.  Consumers seek to verify Internet health information by sharing it during medical consultations.  Clinicians are challenged to quickly and skillfully appraise the information and relate it to the patient’s care.  This new interpretive role is consistent with the goals of patient-centered care, but is often problematic for the clinician.  The mission of our new venture is to help clinicians and patients partner more effectively on education, positive behavior change and improved health outcomes.

WHF produces the largest continuing medical education program exclusively dedicated to comprehensive and integrative health care for women.

Ownership requires a high-value, low-cost ongoing partnership between patients and providers.  We aim to solve the two most basic problems in healthcare – lack of patient ownership and effective partnership between patient and providers.   These twin peaks create misunderstanding, missed opportunity, excessive diagnostics, wasted care and inferior outcomes.  We provide web-based platforms to help patients and providers solve these problems to improve outcomes and decrease costs.

We have 'pre-loaded' our platforms for musculoskeletal conditions (back pain, arthritis, carpal tunnel, etc.) based on their prevalence, fit with what we offer and unmet need.  

Specifically, our tools do 4 things...

1.  Facilitate good, cost-effective conversations. 
Evidence based decision support for doctors and patients.    After Visit Summaries.  Pre and Post-Op instructions.  Health Gateway allows providers to create customized treatment plans for patients and then monitor and support patient compliance and outcomes.  Also serves as the point of care coordination for providers (eg, PCP, NP, PT, surgeon)

2.  Make new behaviors easy and automatic. 
‘Solution packages’ for each condition.  Reminder Tool helps people incorporate exercises, treatments and lifestyle changes into their lives.    Health Rewards encourage people to use programs, record their outcomes and improve their health.  Health Family engages the whole family to win movie tickets and dinners out. 

3.  Record treatments and outcomes.
Our tools create an integrated perspective of treatments and outcomes for each patient. We make it easy and worthwhile for patients to record outcomes.

4.  Interoperate.  
Seamlessly share data with PHRs/EHRs/EMRs.  Allow providers to easily add their own content to Health Gateway.  We have ‘pre-loaded’ our tools for musculoskeletal conditions.  It is straightforward to load other conditions.

Capturing data intelligently opens opportunities for computers to seamlessly transfer information between systems without losing context and provide decision support based on best practices and required standards. 

Product development starts with a best practice developed by a professional society or teaching institution or simple data capture checklist.  The protocol or checklist is integrated into a computerized template that is stored with correlating clinical knowledge and reference material.  mTuitive suite of software solutions consume and deliver these templates to everyday users on their workstations, touchscreen kiosks or via the web.  Our team of human factors professionals have developed efficient and powerful user interfaces that correlate to the appropriate use case. The user follows the template in the software and inputs data electronically.  Results data may be collected in an mTuitive repository for patient records and future analysis.  The end result greatly simplifies the process of entering patient information or clinical findings and keeps the users up-to-date and educated.

Templates and products are developed by teaming our mTuitive knowledge engineers with input domain experts in our online xPert Community. As more members take part in the Community, product focus is expanded and the xPert product enterprise becomes more valuable.

I have since been part of a founding or management team for a number of software startup companies - some proved to be financially successful, a few did not.

We consistently achieve high scores in customer satisfaction and offer some of the best prices on the Internet. 

More than two years in the making, HealthWarehouse.com officially launched in August 2006. Literally started from a garage, HealthWarehouse.com runs a software technology center in Asia, manufacturers it's own products from a FDA approved manufacturing facility and ships thousands of orders a month from a state-of-the-art warehouse in Cincinnati, OH.

Founded by a pharmaceutical industry veteran who has put more than $10 billion worth of drugs on the market, a pharmacist with 25 years experience running pharmacy chains, and an Internet veteran with more than 15 years of experience on the web,  HealthWarehouse.com has the expertise and experience to deliver on the promise of change in the healthcare industry.

The formula for success has been relentless attention to the customer experience and ""doing whatever it takes to make it right."" With scores consistently ranking above 98% on Amazon.com , HealthWarehouse.com sole focus is on the customer. Unlike other large companies, HealthWarehouse.com does NOT believe ""service can be outsourced"" to another country, and handles all customer service functions in the USA.

Customer service does not just mean focusing on ratings and numbers. HealthWarehouse.com goes above and beyond what most companies consider ""100% customer satisfaction"". Providing an industry leading 90-day return policy on all items sold, no restocking fees, handling defective product returns to manufacturers, and even referring customers to competitor websites when an item is out of stock is what separates HealthWarehouse.com from others in the healthcare industry.

As healthcare costs continue to rise and average Americans suffer from the lack of affordable health insurance, the drug companies and large drug wholesalers continue to grow fatter. HealthWarehouse.com's goal from day 1 was simple: remove every possible layer of cost between the manufacturer and the consumer. By manufacturing its own products or by sourcing them directly from the manufacturer, HealthWarehouse.com cuts out the middlemen and passes the savings on to you, the consumer.

Construction began in January 2008 on a full-scale, state-of-the-art FDA-approved pharmacy which can handle more than 12,000 prescriptions per day. HealthWarehouse.com plans to begin selling prescription products by April 2008 on a limited basis and to all 50 states by the end 2008.

"63","Mike","Kirkwood","CEO","Polka","http://www.polka.com","mike@polka.com","5103164501","","Polka is a secure aggregation and collaboration service to help users manage their health, backed by our core My Health, My Team portal and the belief that data portability begins with “me.”   

WHY IT IS IMPORTANT AND COMPELLING
Today’s complex healthcare system grapples with outdated paper systems and unconnected, diverse IT systems, resulting in a lack of timely, accurate information and collaboration, as well as costly financial and treatment errors in patients’ healthcare.  All of us deal with difficult, if not impossible, access to our own health information and archaic ways to communicate with our health team.

Polka keeps users’ health information up-to-date and available anytime, anywhere – whether it’s for routine check-ups, daily prescription and supplement tracking, during the critical moment of emergencies, or seamless sharing and communication within users’ core team of family, friends, and health professionals.  

OUR CURRENT APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE PLANS
Polka currently provides individual, go-to-market applications for consumers that not only meet the needs to better manage their health, but could save their lives.  We have several modes of applications so users can simply and easily access information at their fingertips across platforms – whether it’s via mobile, the web, or right in their own wallets with paper or plastic cards.  

We released our first application, the free Emergency Card, on Polka.com in June.  We are offering a version of the Emergency Card application for the iPhone at a price of $2.99 on the iTunes App Store.  Polka is connecting the Emergency Card to our core portal “My Health, My Team,” along with other applications including an allergy tracker, prescription tracker, and advocate management. 

In addition to serving consumers, we will help healthcare organizations remove processing costs, save integration costs, exceed federal mandates, and deliver even better service to patients through Polka.  We plan to be the definitive health portal for the masses within the next year.  

ABOUT POLKA’S TECHNOLOGY 
Polka is a secure, scalable framework that was designed as the first encompassing service for the individual, as a person, connecting to the network.  Polka creates every service with the user at the center and data portability top of mind.  We believe that the user, or “me,” should be centralized because they are the definitive point of control, change, and decision-making.

Security is an utmost priority, demonstrated by our patent-pending secure protocols focusing on information integration across a host of online and offline systems. Our Me Server technology acts as a designated agent, and provides a repository, back-up, and integration of key web and non-web health data to give extreme results in publishing and sharing information.

I am the founder of FertilityTies.com - the first comprehensive online space dedicated to meeting the specific needs of men and women trying to conceive and/or going through reproductive health issues, enabling millions of men and women to:

·Connect with others who can help and/or offer support 
·Compare information, options and findings to make better decisions
·Conceive in ways that are time efficient, less costly, supportive and compassionate

We will become the leading online brand enabling millions of men and women to find medical advice, peer-support, education, information and tools they need to proactively take charge of their own reproductive health. 

Some statistics include:

- 30MM women trying to conceive in the U.S. in 2007  

- Over 7MM men and women in the U.S going through infertility, 3.5 MM in the U.K., 600,000 in Canada – the estimated global amount is 50MM-80MM 

- 61.6 MM women   and 75.4MM men   of reproductive age in the U.S. in 2007  

-Over 37MM women in the U.S. are entering the age of Menopause  

-Over 3.2MM female teenagers/young adults in the U.S. have at least one common STD.

FertilityTies.com was the first online community specifically built to serve the reproductive health market and is currently the only site that provides daily medical assistance in and information on family planning. This is achieved two ways*:

1. Access to a team of live, unbiased medical experts

2. Search and tagging technology that provides fast and relevant information

*Future offerings will include Matching Capabilities, Comparative Searches and Data Mining for Pharmaceuticals.

With our current offerings, FertilityTies.com is already beginning to revolutionize the current method for finding information and support for part of this niche market: conception, infertility and pregnancy. Our next phase of development with expand these offerings to serve the rest of our target market (menopause, STDs, reproductive health, men’s issues) which, although currently being addressed to a lesser extent, will receive proportionate attention and resource availabilities.

FertilityTies.com will create revenues through 4 different areas: 

1. Social Lead Generation (development of matching technology between users and fertility specialists and generating leads) 

2. Advertisement, sponsorships and data mining for pharmaceuticals.

3. E-Commerce (sale of FertilityTies.com branded fertility supplements, and affiliate products relevant to conception)

Our visitors spend an average of 20 minutes per visit on the site and we have a very close-knit community already planning an offline community to meet each other and their families. With a very loyal following some of our users could potentially share their experiences at Health 2.0 conferences.

We welcome the opportunity to share our business plan with you. We are very excited to not only be part of helping people achieve their dreams of having a family, but also being a part of creating a healthier community – for generations to come.

It is an ideal platform for health care and os accessible via a secure, RESTful, Application Programming Interface (API).

Please see http://videntity.com for a brief (pre-launch) product description.

A few ""MUST HAVE"" features of Videntity Include:

-Customizable Telephone-based Identity Verification AND Authorization.   (Its not just verifying identity, but getting express permission for something)  We have a novel, patent-pending, two-way identity verification that prevents ""vishing"" (i.e. telephone based phishing scams).

-Text Message Notifications

- Biometric Verification (Voice, Iris, Fingerprint)

-Automatic Digitizing and Codification of paper documents through a fax machine.

All of the technology is our own including voice recognition, iris recognition, paper digitization/codification, etc.  We're the identity experts.

Below is some information not yet on the website which can give you a better understanding of how Videntity works:

How to Use Videntity in Just 3 Easy Steps

Step 1: Sign Up.  Sign up to receive an Entity (Organizational) account and an API key to access the service.  Enjoy a 60 Day free trial.  Service fees are based on the number of accounts created and the volume of transactions. Click Here to See the Current Pricing.    Optionally, you can setup a Videntity Server on your local host to automatic receive data.

The next steps can be performed by your applications or one of the samples clients provided for free at http://videntity.com/downloads

Step 2: Create Your Accounts.  Create “Agent Accounts” for your Agents, Employees, or anyone who will be acting on behalf of the Entity Organization. (More on Agent Accounts...)  Create “Population Accounts” for your  your general user base. Depending on your requirements, these user make up your Customers, Account Holders, Patients, General Public, Devices, etc.  (More on Population Accounts....)

Step 3: Use Videntity.  Send and receive transactions from Videntity.   There are two main transaction types, “Send” and “Request”.  The verification and communications portions of the transaction are handled automatically by Videntity.  Videntity will handle the transaction differently based on the makeup of the transaction, the entity's settings, and user account settings.  Transactions and their responses follow a very simple, straightforward, schema.   Please see the Developer Wiki and the API documentation for more detailed information.  Also, help yourself to free sample applications, many many of which include source code.

My focus is healthcare.

Over the next year I want to ask some bigger questions, such as:

- Are physicians, CEOs, and CMIOs thinking about longitudinal care?  As in, care that is based on an evidence pool filled with a lifetime of individual clinical health history, as well as family history.

- How is chronic care treatment being impacted by the development of innovative technologies?  Are health outcomes, patient adherence to a care plan, and reimbursements being positively impacted by data collected outside the care center?

Aberdeen has a unique research methodology that has only been applied to the healthcare space minimally.

With our research, I hope to spur interest and understanding in the technologies on the market that enable patient-centric care.  Over the next 12 months and onward, I plan on furiously writing about solutions and their functionality, standards, and events, like Health 2.0!

Similar to my weekend plans, which involve running down the state of New Hampshire in a relay race, I bring an ""anything-is-possible"" mentality to a lot of my endeavors.  

There are good and bad aspects of this: on the positive side, I plan on putting a lot of effort behind my newest challenge (the healthcare research, not the race) and on the less positive side, my sincere interest in healthcare technology makes me really want to attend Health 2.0 at the discounted rate.

Our first product was called My Emergency Information, it launched day 1 with the iPhone App Store.   The Polka team has been iterating the product based on customer feedback and has distinguished ourself in our category as a service that enabled phone, print, and web collaboration of my key health information.

Customers asked us to do two things, both have emerged as our second and third products.   First, to make emergency information contacts ubiquitous and free on the phone.   Polka launched our new application Close Call, to meet this need.   This application allows a user to easily create a wallpaper strip with their information on their phone, even when it is locked.

The second thing our customers asked us to do was enable a full record about themselves, but tailored to how they would like to access it on the iPhone (or other smart phone).   In October, we release our My Health portal, which combines a our print, web, and phone platform to enable and share it's data based on a CCR.   Polka's key offering allows a user to update the CCR from multiple points, gather other records of facts about themselves, and distribute the information to the needed audience on the web, in print forms, or on their phone.

We combined a little of Twitter, CCR, identity frameworks like oAuth, with things we all know, like PDF.   When it is arranged properly, it becomes a web portal that shares my inforamtion to people the way they need it.

Our goal:  manage the boundary between clinical and social, with the person in the spotlight and control point of their data. The key collaboration tool we have built is called My Team, a communication tool powers me to share the key facts about myself, without the challenge of managing my record.

For the 44 million people who currently qualify for Medicare, and for the “Silver Tsunami” of Baby Boomers that will begin turning 65 in 2010, choosing the right health insurance has never been easy. In today’s world that offers thousands of choices with conflicting information and minor, yet crucial, variations between options – decision making can be downright intimidating.  As a result, individuals rely on word of mouth, dubious “expert” opinions, or simply pick the least/most expensive health plan – often ending up with something that doesn’t meet their needs.

"92","Richard","Anglin","President","TelMedX","","rlanglin@telmedx.com","8584364660","","The TelMedX business plan is based on using a patient’s own cell phone camera to provide visual triage, remote diagnosis and health status monitoring anytime, anywhere.  Providing two-way video in the affordable and mobile form factor of the patient’s existing cell phone makes it possible to realize the benefits of telemedicine on an unprecedented scale.  When a physician sees a patient in the office, his or her visual observation of the patient is one of the primary factors in diagnosis and treatment.  Observations such as facial expression, pupil dilation, range of motion, breathing rate (especially in infants) and color of rash or wound are cornerstones of medical care.  TelMedX’s technology takes the office visit to the patient both in location and in time.

The healthcare economic benefits of TelMedX’s technology may be measured in terms of emergency room (ER) diversions.  In several large healthcare systems, audio-based telephone triaging is a significant part of their portfolio of primary care services.  As one example, a large California medical insurance plan operates three large call centers in California for this purpose.  In Southern California alone it handles sixty thousand (60,000) medical calls per month, approximately forty percent (40%) of which are sent to the ER.  Analysis of the call center protocols for these consultations indicates that if the healthcare provider could perform a rudimentary visual exam of the patient instead of just conversing with them up to sixty percent (60%) of the ER diversion could be avoided.  Thus a visual consultation via cell phone could save about another fourteen thousand (14,000) ER visits per month just within this health plan’s Southern California region.  This medical insurance plan assesses the cost of an ER visit at $1,000.  Thus, adding video would save this single healthcare system $14 million a month in Southern California alone.

TelMedX is focused on developing and deploying its technology and partnering with healthcare providers to deliver telemedicine services.","","","","","","","","Self financed to date.","TelMedX can already demonstrate medical-grade™ video between common cell phones over 2.5G and 3G networks.

For expediency the existing software has been implemented using a proprietary protocol running on top of TCP/IP.  In Stage 1 a standards-based communications stack will be integrated, thereby enabling interworking with a variety of VoIP-based products.

We have built ""HealthMatch"" a unique algortyhm that will match people together by condition, medications, treatments, etc.  People are able to create their health profile in their membership to the site - and then others can find them by specific diseases, conditions, healthcare facilities, etc.  We provide the traditional groups and forum support for people, and also allow direct conversations to occur with other members of the site.

We have also built a Healthcare oriented social bookmarking engine so that people can register articles and tag these articles with their healthcare relevance.  This allows people to later find articles by ""Cancer: Breast"" and then view all these articles with their rankings from other members.

The business is running on its own now. We are not eager to try to find new clients at the moment because imports are very much down 2ndary to the economy and the cost of gas in trans-oceanic shipping. As a physician, I have other more focused interests that relate to Health 2.0.

Finances:

Partner equity funding ensured but no formal escrow set-up yet.
2.8mil in committed intellectual capital and cash. 

Multiple  physicians involved.

Anticipated 100k in debt - financed through my import   management company

1st round we will be seeking .5-1mil in equity funding......

I'm an ER doc. I have cut down on my working hours to almost zero to  work on this new start-up.....all my other money is tied up in Chinese rmb.

That work is being done, primarily through the state funding noted above, by VITL (Vermont Information Technology Leaders), in collaboration with the Vermont Department of Health, the Vermont Department of Information and Innovation, and the Vermont Blueprint for Health, with the coordination of the Office of Vermont Health Access & Health Care Reform.  

The Vermont legislature and executive share a clear vision for bringing enhanced communication, care coordination, and ""systemness"" to Vermont's health care delivery system. HIT and HIE are key to that effort, but the technology alone is not sufficient to success in achieving our vision.  We understand that the human beings (patients and providers) must be equally engaged and comfortable in this transformation of practice.  Because of the emphasis Vermont has placed on primary care (and the expansion of a sophisticated Medical Home, community care coordination, multi-payer reimbursement model), our HIT & HIE is being built from the ground (patient and provider) up, addressing issues of patient privacy and confidentiality and access to and control over their own data as a critical first step.
 ","","","","","","","","The state of Vermont has made -- and continues to make -- substantial investments in HIT and HIE, starting in 2005, expanding in 2006 with Vermont's landmark health care reform legislation, and expanding further in 2008 with the creation of a state HIT fund to subsidize EMR/EHR implementation in primary care practices and connectivity to the state HIE.  The state -- and our partners -- have also made investments in practice change and redesign training and support, utilizing Dartmouth's Clinical Microsystems change process tools.","Like most (all?) states this month, we are closely examining the opportunities related to HIT & HIE in the stimulus bills being developed in Congress, which could bring resources that would complement the existing state funding and insurance claim surcharges that pay into the state HIT fund.  Vermont will also continue to seek, through our State Office of Rural Health & Primary Care, HRSA and other HHS grant funding directly and in collaboration with partner organizations.

","N/A","A long time public health/Medicaid/primary care policy wonk, I joined state government earlier this month, after serving for seven years as Director of Vermont Public Policy for Bi-State Primary Care Association.  In that role, I worked on the development of the health care reform legislation I am now responsible for seeing successfully implemented. Throughout my health policy career, I have carefully tracked the deployment of IT in health care, watched many failed efforts, and share many of the concerns and hopes routinely articulated in THCB and other on-line forums. I am hopeful that the time is right to make significant steps toward achieving true systems (and quality of care) improvements with IT tools.  I would appreciate the opportunity to come to Health 2.0 to become more fully informed about work going on around the country and how it can be applied in Vermont.","2009-01-24 01:12:44","public","","","216.114.136.76","1","1"

1) We've developed algorithms to VERY ACCURATELY quantify how much a company is losing every day due to various degrees of employee health.  We mine an employer's data to target the top three costliest health issues, which 100% of the time can be traced back to nutrition-related issues.  These include obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and metabolic syndrome among others.  

2) After doing #1, we provide the services necessary to reduce risk factors associated with the health issues that are costing employers money in lost productivity, absenteeism, worker's comp claims, morale, etc.  

3) We hold workshops across the country to teach companies how to create and maintain their own wellness program.  These workshops are popular and are based on industry best practices and our experience with what works.  The workshops offer CE credits for HR professionals.

HOW WE WANT TO GROW:
1) We want to develop a seamless integration of health risk assessment data into an employee's electronic health record (employee optional).

A year ago, I met a primary care physician that had successfully enrolled 500 pre paid clients that showed up 3.8 times a year on average and paid him $400 to see him using a postacrd and in office signage. I felt a model with $100 office visits with a 40% reduction in burden to the physician, no deductibles co-pays or premiums for the patient had a space to grow in.

Healarium customers are primarily health plans (insurers) and self insured employers (self funded employers) who offer the Healarium Personal Health Assiatnt (PHA) to their members, as part of their branded offering. 
In the past decade, payers in the American private healthcare market experienced 6% annual increases of cost.
Healarium’s mission is to help health plans and self-insured employers reduce these rising costs. The Healarium web-based PHA is designed to provide personalized coaching and empowerment to consumers, so that they can promote their own wellness or self-manage their chronic conditions, thereby reducing costs normally delegated to their healthcare plan or employer.
Healarium puts authoritative, trusted expertise and support tools in the hands of health plan members. The expertise and tools maintain, promote, and improve members’ health and lifestyle by assisting them in adhering to medical recommendations and interventions. The Healarium solution incorporates medical knowledge from recognized experts and delivers it to consumers in an understandable, easy-to-use, and personalized manner. 

Healarium is developing an innovative software solution that presents several breakthroughs to the Personal Health IT market. Namely, it: 
	Assists consumers in adopting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle through patient self-management. By facilitating health stakeholder coaching, encouragement, and oversight, Healarium ensures personalized health program success.
	Provides a confidential means for health plans or employers to monitor medical program adherence and progress based on consumer’s activities, without infringing on patient privacy.
	Provides a channel for health plans and employers to reward and incentivize consumers for progress and program adherence.
The Healarium PHA solution is an Internet-based Software as a Service (SaaS) offering, consisting of the following two main components:
	The Composer is a patent-pending set of innovative wizards that helps senior physicians and healthcare experts formulate their expertise in a user-friendly and structured fashion. Once formulated, the expertise is utilized to analyze a consumer’s health information (e.g. test results or physical data), and craft and assign an appropiate, personalized care plan. 
	The PHA (Personal Health Assistant) is a personalized, consumer self-management support system with an easy-to-use, web-based interface. The system presents a new model for managing wellness and chronic conditions, as a normal part of everyday life, with assistance and supervision from consumers’ trusted caregivers. 
Healarium ushers in a next-generation solution by customizing the online PHA product to consumers’ preferences. This yields a total transformation of the traditional case management (manned call center) model. 
The Healarium solution integrates with and complements existing healthcare solutions such as PHR (namely Microsoft HealthVault and Google Health) or EMR, and those availabe from content providers (for example: WebMD and HealthWise), thereby adding outreach value to existing services. The solution is intended to be used by consumers under the supervision of an authorized expert, such as a health case manager. By using the Healarium PHA, consumers who experience chronic conditions can maintain a sustainable and stable
condition. Healthy consumers more easily adopt and adhere to a wellness plan, with significant capacity to prevent future chronic illnesses.

The first is to help propel the healthcare industry,  and more specifically, pharma, towards faster adoption of emerging technologies.  Having been in big pharma for many years, we understand the bureacracy and current mindset of organizations and we can strategically assist technology companies to appropriately position themselves, guide the organizational change management that will be required for adoption and lend credibility to the 'cause'.  To put it simply, we believe we can help 'build a bridge' between the two industries.

Our second area of focus is patients-the real reason why both of us have been in the industry for so long.  We are passionate about arming patients and physicians with the tools that will lead to improved healthcare.

I have a reputation of driving change in big organizations-more on that in a minute.

At that point, I was hooked!  

Together, we have driven technology at GSK by developing and leading several technology based initiatives for the Commercial side of the organization.  No, we are not technology experts-we are business experts who understand what technology can bring to a commercial organization.  Examples of our experience include leading the first VideoSales initiative for GSK in the early 90's, building the first Customer Response (call center) within big pharma, and designing the first Integrated Marketing team with channel experts who teamed with brand experts to begin leveraging alternative Marketing channels.

Autism affects 1 out of every 150 children born today. This number keeps rising every year. Early intervention is critical and can change the direction of a child's life.

My incentive for this new endeavor is the consequence of having been recently laid off (along with 4 others) after 8.5 years as a senior business analyst at Orange Labs San Francisco (France Telecom R&D) in South San Francisco.

At one time, Orange Labs San Francisco had a significant focus on healthcare and I was their most knowledgeable analyst in the healthcare domain. I was the corporate affiliate representative to Stanford Medical Informatics. My focus included extensive analysis of the telemedicine industry, medical device industry including body computing devices, assistance for the disabled (enhanced hearing devices), an analysis of electronic medical records and personal health record providers (Google Health, Microsoft HealthVault, Revolution Health, and WebMD) and an assessment of the B2B opportunity for the provision of business intelligence applications to providers and payers delivered through a hosted or SaaS Web interface.

My previous experience includes being the Manager of IT and Decision Support at the San Jose Medical Group (SJMG) where I was responsible for implementing and managing a large data warehouse with financial, clinical, health plan, and third-party payor information, and for all of the reporting and analysis throughout the organization. That included training the end-users (nurses, managers, department heads and corporate executives). 

Prior to that, I was the Physician Contract Manager at the San Jose Medical Group. I managed over 100 physician contracts, created financial models of predicted business, negotiated contract rates and terms for contracts, revenue forecasting methodologies, competitive marketplace analysis; and strategic business development of new contract opportunities.

     I don't represent a Health 2.0 company, but I was wondering if I might nonetheless be eligible for a scholarship or discounted rate.  I am currently in career flux after having spent my early working years as a rural family physician.  I have been a technophile for as long as I can remember, and I became interested in medical information technology early in my residency at UCSD, which I completed in 2001.  
     Although I remain an inveterate medical nerd, I quickly became disillusioned about my ability to provide high quality clinical care as a cog within the American healthcare system.  During the same period that I was burning out as a clinician, my wife determined that life in the sticks wasn’t for her, and we subsequently moved to Los Angeles in 2006 so that I could begin a fellowship in health services research at UCLA.  I was early in my job hunt following the conclusion of my fellowship last year when we had an unexpected death in the family.  My life has essentially been on hold since then.
     I first became aware of your organization through The Health Care Blog, and I've been reading about the upcoming conference with great interest.  An opportunity to attend would both satisfy my professional curiosity and provide me with networking opportunities that might lead to new employment.  Thanks very much for considering my request.

I have worked in the tech industry for the past 14 years doing marketing for hardware and software manufacturers and I would like to learn more about technology arena specifically for the healthcare vertical.  Most recently I worked for Interwoven and we sold document management software to law firms and accounting firms.

Our first area of focus is men's health, where we've changed the prostate cancer screening debate* from ""to screen or not to screen"" to ""screen better."" We do this through the use of advanced mathematical modeling techniques to combine biomarkers such as the PSA with other inputs to achieve much higher specificity and sensitivity than is possible today, in part by drawing off of the latest best practices from leading institutions such as Johns Hopkins, Duke and the University of California, San Francisco.

With 34 million family caregivers spending on average 20 hours/week for 8 years, taking care of 39 million seniors (equivalent to $375 billion in unpaid services last year alone), and the number of seniors increasing 3 times faster than the number of caregivers, Kinnexxus provides much-needed tools to help caregivers become more efficient and effective at caring for their seniors. Kinnexxus has applied for a provisional patent on the collaborative gerontechnology method and system that supports seniors thriving in the home of their choice, engaging and connecting seniors via a home appliance-like adaptable touchscreen kiosk. Supporting healthy living habits and strengthening their support networks via the Kinnexxus service helps reverse the trend to move seniors into more expensive care facilities each time they encounter difficulties in their IADLs (instrumental activities of daily living) or ADLs (activities of daily living). Each move to a more intense care facility not only decreases the senior's independence but also increases the cost of care tenfold with each subsequent move. The Kinnexxus service supports overwhelmed and stressed-out family caregivers by allowing them to share caregiving responsibilities with other family members, wherever the live. In addition, Kinnexxus supports professional care providers in communicating with family caregivers and keeps everyone, including the seniors themselves, in the loop.","","","","","","","","Founders and management team have contributed approximately $150K and 2.5 years of sweat equity so far.","$500K seed round to complete product testing, build out the infrastructure to support the SaaS, develop and conduct marketing campaign, and launch the product.","have not launched product yet","I have 30 years of experience in family counseling, gerontechnology, virtual community development, and e-commerce, and have been a family caregiver for more than 10 years.

Welcome to the new cloud - a cloud that isn't about computers or technology, but a CLOUD that's about you. Information technology and the Internet have multiplied the places 'you' exist. From your online financial site to information transcribed from paper forms you complete in your doctor's waiting room; from Facebook to Twitter; from your child's school to your employer's HR office; how many times have you entered the same information about you multiple times?

The Internet holds great potential to help patients, students, consumers, and investors achieve the best treatments, participate in the most appropriate classes, find the best deals, and balance risk and return. Standing athwart these possibilities are privacy, security, and identity challenges. We're telling those challenges: Get off of our CLOUD.

The Consortium for Local Ownership and Use of Data aims to make it easier for you to identify yourself and put you in control of the information about your identity. We're a nonprofit organization dedicated to advocacy, research, and standards to fundamentally reorganize the Internet into something that's more about us and less about the people who use our information. Instead, we aim to empower the people who use our information to serve us without the added burden and cost of storing and protecting our information.","","","","","","","Please treat this information as highly confidential.

Prior to CLOUD, Gary was most recently a member of the founding team and Vice President of Sales & Marketing for Kimbia Software, Inc., a leader in online fundraising technology. Prior to Kimbia, Gary not only advised companies through Nueva Vista Ventures, LLC on strategic growth in the areas of product innovation, market segmentation and channel development but served as Apple’s Region Manager for Education in Texas, where he led a team of higher education and K12 Account Executives to be the leading education region in the division in 2006.  Prior to this responsibility, Gary held a variety of sales and marketing positions at Apple in education, channel sales and corporate accounts. 

Gary's varied interests have also included the launch of the Texas eCommerce Association in the late 1990s to bring together executives in Texas around the rapidly evolving internet and eCommerce business models. It was during his time leading Texas eComm that he was appointed by Governor Bush to the eGovernment Task Force, work which continued when he was reappointed by Governor Perry to the Texas Online Authority. Gary is engaged politically through his affiliation with the Maverick PAC of Texas and as Travis County Steering Committee Chair for Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison’s run for Governor.  He is also the Board Development Chair for the Central Texas Board of Trustees of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and Cubmaster for Pack 23 at St. Andrew’s Episcopal School.   He is also a non-trustee member of the NUIT Oversight Committee of the Board of Trustees, a role he has held for the past ten years. 

Gary's passion for education is reflected in his own pursuit of knowledge and learning. Gary received his BA at Northwestern University in 1987, continuing with an MBA at the Kellogg School of Management in 1992 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Texas School of Law in 2000. During his legal studies, Gary also served as the Editor-in-Chief for the nationally recognized Texas Review of Law and Politics.  ","2009-09-22 05:45:29","public","","","24.227.161.246","1","1"

Project Access partners with healthcare providers (including physicians, hospitals, imaging centers, etc) to provide free care to the working poor.  This benefits the community by coordinating charity care, reducing unnecessary emergency room visits, and keeping people at work.  Our future vision includes virtual consults, personal health records, and electronic transmission of clinical data.  

A robust virtual consult system will be developed over the next year to reduce the demand for specialist services.  Through our virtual consult system, primary care physicians at community clinics will be able to consult with private specialists about patient care.  This will enable the primary care physician to offer enhanced care at the community clinic and handle patients' health issues without having to use a valuable specialty visit.  

Personal health records will be given to enrolled patient who have access to internet technology at home or through their cell phones.  Project Access case managers will work directly with patients to establish and utilize personal health records to better manage their health.

Electronic transmission of data will enable our volunteers to have all the clinical information they need at their fingertips before the patient even arrives.  Project Access commits to ""packaging"" patients to ensure our volunteers valuable time is well spent.  Electronic transfer is a key strategy to enhancing this packaged data.

I look forward to conversations with people who are as passionate about technology as I am about creating new health care business models designed as if consumers matter.

The delivery of genuinely caring, high quality face-to-face care relies upon heavy use of technology to make the economics of the business model work.  Jiffy Health will live or die by the ease and 'friendliness' of our appointment scheduling UI, as well as our efficient use of EMRs and clinical decision-support algorithms for nurse practitioners and physician assistants.

Imagine you need to find a nursing home for your mom who ended up in a hospital over the weekend due to a cardiac event and now needs to be moved from the hospital to a nursing home on Mon morning. You have less than a day to find the right nursing home for your mom in Florida, 2000 miles away from where you live. You want to find a nursing home that meets your or your mom's needs (cleanliness, location, etc.) and has the appropriate medical rating for the specific services she needs (e.g. take care of cardiac patients). You also need to find a doctor that can visit your mom at that nursing home. MyHealthBazaar will enable you to view list of providers, select providers based on ratings, and make transactions. 
While there are several startups trying to create directory and rating of providers, MyHealthBazaar will be unique due to
1. Exclusive focus on the most urgent service verticals
   - where patient or family needs to make decision in a short period of time
   - verticals where transparency of providers and quality of services is limited and is such transparency if extremely valuable
2. Local market approach
   - built comprehensive list/rating of providers by market (vs. national level)
3. Use of established industry and customer rating standards
   - Service specific industry standards will be used to rate providers
4. Utilize a unique revenue model that created incentives for providers to be listed and rated

"217","Brian","Bauer","CEO","OnTrack Technology, Inc","blog.ontracktechnology.com","brianbauer@ontracktechnology.com","9083068901","","OnTrack Technology offers a compliment of innovative software solutions that employ virtual reality based visualization and interaction to solve very real challenges in the Health and Wellness industries.
OnTrack Health focuses specifically on how the unique multi-sensory capabilities of Virtual Reality can be deployed to address challenges that have defied solutions based on Web1.0 technologies, or outdated medical protocols.
At OnTrack Technology we have taken a good hard look at the economic drivers that fuel the healthcare industry, from Pharma, to Doctor, to Patient.  We know what the “Money Flow” looks like, and we know that what is driving the current frenzy among Health IT companies is the scramble to get a piece of the Money Flow action.  We also know that demand for doctor consultations is growing at a rate that outpaces doctor supply by 10x.  The sophistication of the slickest new EMR’s will be able to handle the ever increasing transaction volumes, but the doctors won’t.   The “front door to healthcare is getting wider, but the waiting room is not getting bigger” and they just aren’t growing doctors like they used to.  But, the draw of being part of the money-flow is just too great for most IT companies, and that is where the vast majority of the IT focus is today.  At OnTrack Technology, we have a slightly different plan….
At OnTrack Technology, we don’t make band-aids, we make products that will help stop the bleeding at the source.  Virtual Reality provides an intensely impactful experience for the user.  Visualization of, and engagement with, abstract medical conditions, creates educational moments for Patients and Health Care providers, that simply cannot be delivered in any other way.  But it is these Educational Moments that allows the doctor to more accurately diagnose and prescribe, and the patient to become empowered with a very deeply seated sense of oneness with their medical condition, and ongoing treatment.  Immersive Contexts have a power that induces the emancipation of the patient’s awareness from the physical world, and into our carefully constructed learning environment. And when we have captured the mind of the patient, we imprint it with a visualization of themselves, crafted using not only their aesthetic appearance, but a physiologically correct rendering of their medical state as well.  But this is not just a colorful picture, it is a virtual “living, breathing” reflection of the patient, with an unrivaled ability to empower the patient with knowledge of their condition, and ongoing care.  And when the doctor writes the patient a prescription, the Virtual Patient takes it first. Our Pharmacokinetic models integrate with our physiology engine(which has been configured using the patient’s EMR) and demonstrate to the patient in visuals that require no interpretations, what they can expect if they Adhere to the required RX.  But we do not abandon the Patient when they walk out of the door of the doctors office.  Because in addition to the RX that they will take to the pharmacy, we have also given them a WX.  The WX is taken home, and from their PC, they apply the Web Prescription to a Portal that contains the same level of immersive experience  they had in the doctors office.
Adherence happens at home, not in the Doctor’s office.  A Unified  Prescription for Health(UPH) is required. At OnTrack Technology, we know this, and that is why our tools live not only with the doctor, but also with the patient.  And every patient who has the UPH, can find others like themselves in a safe environment that is engaging, supportive, and empowering.  
Biometric monitoring devices enable real-time configuration of each Virtual Patient at home.  The tether between Virtual and Real patient is more than just a cable.  It represents a lifeline of information that never allows the patient to forget or deny that they can understand their condition, that they can understand the treatment, and that they can be empowered such that it makes a difference in their lives.
When it is time to consult with the doctor, OnTrack Technology provides the first integrated solution that enables synchronous communication, visualization, and impactful education without the need to leave home.  Improved health reduces demand for medical care, but when doctor consultations are required, OnTrack Technology provides viable alternatives.  Virtual Reality based Consultation Alternatives that facilitate more than “questionnaire based” analysis, do not make the waiting room bigger, but they do ensure that there is a seat available when nothing else but “hands on” treatment will be sufficient.  Patients want alternatives.  Payers recognize the value, and OnTrack Technology provides efficiency tools that for the first time enable the doctor to improve care, without having to turn away patients as a consequence. 
OnTrack Technology is a partner to EMR’s, medical device manufactures, information providers and Pharma.  OnTrack Technology provides solutions where they are absent, and bridges the best technologies where they already exist.  OnTrack Technology uses visualization and user engagement to provide cohesion in an industry defined by an otherwise disconnected federation of Healthcare IT tools.  The science of the lab, the lessons from clinical trials, the medication-based education of doctors, the empowerment of the patient through education, and the persistence of the patient supported by community, consultation, and understanding is what creates an environment in which good health is possible.  OnTrack Technology provides this environment.

Living in New Mexico and especially working with our only Level I trauma center, most patients do not have insurance but the doctors I work with have made it their mission to give the best care possible.  Three years ago we started our company when our founding physician was frustrated with how long it took him to fix a facial fracture (90 minutes) and the significant complications rates that plagued most patients all over the world (30%).  He wanted easier more efficient and innovative products but the major players in the industry had stifled innovation and have been selling products that were patented in the 1930s.  Soon our company was born over the $50,000 we put into it.  Our mission is to work with physicians to quickly push out innovative products very quickly.  We have gone from conception of product to FDA approval in 6 months.  Most companies take years.  We are able to do this by using sophisticated engineering software that mimics bone movements and can quickly do analysis on our products.  Without new innovative software our company would not exist.  

I have 2 needs that I would like to fulfill at Health 2.0.  I would like to look into the latest and greatest technology that allows physicians to collect outcomes on patients and the possibility of any new design software that allows physicians to be innovative.

The integrated health insurance benefit product partners employees with providers to maintain their health, allows them to self fund for expected or smaller unexpected expenses, and insures against unexpected high cost events.

The target market for WH1 is small employers (20 to 200 lives) served by benefit brokers.  WH1 offers an affordable alternative to high deductible coverage that improves work force productivity because each employee has a doctor and team focused on their health.  The broker feedback has been all positive--they want the product now!

WH1 will launch in the Seattle market where several large, brand name clinics and integrated systems have expressed strong interest, identifying specific locations for conversion from fee for service to the capitated, monthly retainer business model.  This conversion allows primary care physicians to reduce panel size, spend significantly more time with patients, and increase practice revenue. WH1 is building on Carol.com's relationships in the market and will license Carol's technology and tools, such as clinical protocols and consumer interface, to facilitate the conversion of existing fee for service practices to the WH1 model.

WH1 will integrate enrollment and billing as well as HSA technology and is working with underwriting partners to offer competitively priced high deductible coverage.

Revenue is through a mark up of the premium and WH1 will be profitable quickly even at modest enrollment levels.

After passing through a middleware solution provided by IBM and Google, the data will be presented in a rich, game-like Adobe Flex application designed to display trend lines and data points in a game like interface, as patients progress over time.  

The stated goal of Crohnology.MD is to visually enhance the patient narrative, by presenting patient observations in a structured, shareable and visually compelling way that answers the all important question: ""How does the patient feel?""  

Crohnology.MD has developed an innovative proposal in conjunction with a trio of grant 'graft on' partners including IBM, Google, and IDEO, who have collaborated to architect a proposed open source health care information service system that allows patients to record and widely share their 'observations of daily living'.

If selected, we will build and deploy our platform with 60 Crohn's patients at the UCSF Mt. Zion Crohn's and Colitis Center.

After making the short list, Nikolai kicked his Interdisciplinary Research Major at UC Berkeley into high gear, taking a full course load at the UC Berkeley School of Information, where he is working with fellow students to build a medical information service system leveraging existing open source technologies provided by IBM and Google.

And by this, we mean we're dedicated to reaching the patients and physicians who are ""over-served"" by high-tech, high-bandwidth solutions.

SMS has transferred the most basic chronic disease treatment algorithms from the doctor's office to the hands of patients.  We've created a web-based application that allows patients to self-manage chronic diseases like asthma, diabetes, and hypertension through interactive text messages.  The system is patient-driven-- a patient ""toolkit""-- and relies on a series of basic, well-established algorithms in chronic disease management.  Our goal is to take a costly and often unnecessary patient visit-- to adjust medicines-- and allow patients to make those changes on their own, with remote guidance.

We've also launched a text message-based reminder system targeting young women who have been prescribed the Gardasil vaccine, a vaccine against the virus that causes cervical cancer.  Based on pilot studies showing dramatic improvements in adherence after text message reminders are sent on the day of the visit, we've created a web-based tool that integrates seamlessly into the workflow of a medical assistant and allows for programmable reminders.

Our business model is based on the administration and support of these clinical algorithms and text message-based reminders.  We see opportunities to scale across the United States and anywhere patients use cell phones. 

The broad vision of SMS is to partner with patients-- they are, after all, the lead users in health care innovation.  Our low-tech ""toolkits"" encourage patients to participate in invention and creation.  Over time, we will measure success based on the extent to which the underserved have been included in the ideas discussed at forums like Health 2.0.

For the past several years, I've pursued medical education and training and am now board-certified in Internal Medicine.  

I love my job.  I take care of patients in the outpatient setting and in my daily work, I witness many challenges but even more opportunities in health care delivery innovation.  To me, the most exciting developments in this field are those that really include patients, those products that reflect on the doctor-patient relationship and seek to enhance it through patient empowerment and more meaningful interactions.  Rather than merely collect more ""patient data"" through sophisticated gadgets, or move more physicians toward increasingly ""hands-on"" patient relationships, I still believe in patient-driven solutions that are simple, cheap, and available to all.  

My company is an attempt to engage patients in new ways-- even though to ask them to adjust their own medications is not novel (we've been doing it with insulin for decades)-- and to partner in ways that lead to meaningful change.  My focus on underserved populations is based on the principle that those with the fewest resources tend to gain the most from system improvements.  Clinical care is no different.

The first is Dutch and called zorghelden.net (translates to heroes of care) and is a healthcare cooperative society. With a Dutch university hospital I aim to develop a full online coach program to help people that suffer from heart disease and diabetes to set and achieve health goals through integrated care coordinated by the coach. The patient side of the website will be 'social' where users can form groups, invite people to their group, stimulate each other with health challenges, exchange experiences they had with coaches, earn points for goals achieved as a group that can be spend online and offline.  On the careprovider side of the website, the online coach program offers the possibility to people with sufficient medical education to participate and enroll as a member of the coorporation, follow training, adopt a standard of care and offer their services to users of the website. Services are paid for by a Dutch healthcare insurer based upon success rate and user satisfaction with the coach. With this initiative I hope to help reduce the demand for care by making the participation in own healthcare fun. Also I hope to help to improve the delivery of integrated care to the user while reducing the (ginourmous upcoming) shortage of careproviders by enabling those who are not active in the medical field today to enroll as a coach.

The second is called healthiez.com (pronounce health ease) which is a platform (full open API) to log personal health outcomes (medication intake, blood pressure, blood glucose, pain, sleep, mood etc) by synchronizing medical applications from a smartphone as well as outcomes from health devices, (bio) sensors and smart medication sensors (all data send via the smartphone). I aim to develop a service to interpret those outcomes through algorithms and correltations into simple graphs and health ratings (from which no medical conclusions should be drawn unless originating from objective monitoring via e.g. sensors, devices connected to the internet). The community discusses health issues related to the things users try to improve, compare scores with other users, give each other challenges to improve and exchange tips.

This productservice shows to significantly improve medication compliance (from 30% to 90% on average). This product is currently being developed in small clinical studies and behavioral studies in various European countries and launched by DSM officially later this year.

I started my high school in Hungary with IT major, but quickly moved on to new challenges in the US. It took me 3 years to finish high school, then I joined the International Business School, a private college in Budapest where I studied economics with marketing major. In my second year I joined Oxford Brookes University in England, and then worked for Zwack Unicum, Hungary's leading alcohol distributer and producer. During my final year in college I spent a semester in Turku (Finland) to further my international business knowledge. I received marketing diplomas from both colleges and another marketing communications diploma from the International Advertising Agency, New York. Upon finishing my college studies he moved to NY and started a marketing and sales job in Midtown Manhattan. 2 years later he started his own B2B sales company, which grew to employ over 20 people. Now he is working full-time on his latest idea, he wants to change the healtcare industry by providing valuable real-time data that can identify early warning signs of potentially acute problems.

Il est un centre d’expertise et un lieu d’expression de la parole et des attentes des patients, et à ce titre un espace où peuvent être proposées et élaborées des nouvelles pratiques de démocratie sanitaire. Il promeut et coordonne des actions innovantes d'information, d'accompagnement et de mise en réseau de patients, de leurs proches, des associations et des professionnels de santé, et permet ainsi l’expression d’une parole experte auprès des instances politiques et de la société civile.  

La création de cet espace de réflexion et de co-construction indépendant et neutre, ouvert à des interlocuteurs différents, peut ainsi contribuer à analyser les évolutions de la société sur la prise en charge de la maladie, mettre en lumière les pratiques émergentes, être force de propositions auprès des responsables dans un objectif de changement de certaines pratiques.   

Il peut également favoriser « l’empowerment » des associations et la coopération entre ces dernières et les systèmes de santé (notamment au sein des réseaux ville-hôpital), développer des outils de participation d’usagers n’adhérant pas au milieu associatif et qui se retrouvent, volontairement ou non,  en dehors des dispositifs collectifs.

Le pôle propose à ceux qui le souhaitent de partager ses actions autour de l'idée centrale de donner au patient la possibilité d’être informé, de s’engager, de devenir acteur de sa santé, ""expert"" dans son champ de compétence, désireux de partager et d'améliorer son expertise et d'entretenir un dialogue équilibré et responsable avec les soignants.

Il s'inscrit entièrement dans les objectifs et recommandations du Plan Cancer 2.

A situation putting a doctor opposite a patient with a defined need for surgery, and using a web-based consent system, offers a unique marketing and supply chain opportunity for companies involved in that sphere of medicine, as well as patient information opportunities.

I am considering relocating as well.

The full price registration rate is a bit steep for me and I am hoping that I could be eligible for a discounted individual rate.   I would greatly appreciate if I am considered for a discount because I think this conference would be a fantastic opportunity for me and hopefully I could be a presenting participant or sponsor in the near future! :)","Consulting company, offering technology, PR, design, strategy or other services?","","","","NA","NA.
