2,adrian,rawlinson,MD,cposm,www.cposm.com,arawlinson@cposm.com,,"The development of the electronic medical record system.  As a physician, I have worked with several electronic systems dating back to the crude DOS based systems in the 1980s.  I am currently working with an 11 physician practice in San Francisco which uses the Allscripts electronic medical records system.  I believe the president of Allscripts, Mr. Lee Shapiro, spoke at the last Health 2.0 conference in San Francisco.  Over the last two and of years we have transformed our practice from a paper laden system to an electronic paperless system. In addition to the use of an EMR we have also integrated a digital imaging system within our practice.  These two systems combined have contributed to an overall increase in efficiency and have reduced costs quite considerably.  The various aspects of this presentation would include the choice of an EMR, implementation and streamlining the process for individual practices.  My other area of interest within the healthcare IT arena is the development of comprehensive and current medical information for the use of the consumer on the web. I think the information available on the many websites, for example WebMD, is very superficial. I am currently working on a project called Melioguide (check out www.MelioGuide.com). This is an example of a medical condition [osteoporosis] which has been approached in some detail.  The main emphasis of the site is the provision of a specific, custom-made exercise program for use in patients who have been diagnosed with osteoporosis/osteopenia or would simply like to prevent bone loss in the future. The site has been created in conjunction with a physical therapist who specializes in this area.  Currently the information is free to both consumers and physicians alike but we are looking various subscription models in order to help finance the project.","specialty: Musculoskeletal & Sports Medicine Adrian J.

By 2020, it is estimated this number to increase to more than 60 million. Baby boomers (born born between 1946 and 1964) are finding themselves among the largest group of people in the country impacted by this growth, with 41 percent currently helping to care for older family members with personal aid, financial assistance, or both.  With the staggering growth in people caring for an aging or ailing parent, boomers are now finding themselves in the position of making decisions about their parent’s care, while also making important decisions about their own future. Often, they wonder, “how do I plan for my future, while caring for my parent today?”     ","Andy Cohen is Chief Executive Officer and a co-founder of Caring.com. He oversees the company's operations and finances, with the goal of establishing Caring.com as the premiere website for people taking care of their parents and other aging loved ones. Andy has launched four successful web businesses, taking them from start-up to tens of millions of dollars in revenue. In a 20-year career before founding Caring.com, he held leadership positions in management, marketing, and sales with S.C. Johnson Wax, Intuit, Peapod, Instill, and SuccessFactors. He serves on the board of directors for two non-profit organizations -- Volunteers in Asia (VIA) and the Los Altos Educational Foundation. Andy holds a B.A. in history from Stanford University and an M.B.A. in marketing from Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management.  Andy grew up in Glencoe, Illinois. He now lives with his wife and two young children in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he enjoys cycling in the foothills overlooking Silicon Valley. While caring for his mom during her losing battle with lung cancer, Andy realized there wasn't a comprehensive website that helped people figure out how to handle in-home care, choose products to help with daily living, and make the right financial and legal decisions. Caring.com was founded to meet those needs, and to make a difficult journey a little bit  easier.   ",2008-02-19 03:45:15,public,,,99.161.115.124,1,1

Our company is exploring the use of web widgets as a way to deliver our trusted health content directly to websites where this information is pertinent and beneficial.  For example, a college blogger writing about his or her personal experience with severe acne could use web widgets to provide clinical images and information or a working mom's community could deliver information about the proper way to perform a monthly skin cancer self-exam.  I would propose presenting on the benefits of this linkage between the traditional ""clinical information"" typically housed on large health portals with the social aspects and relevancy associated with delivering this information at the point of interest.

40,Ben,Bergman,Executive Director,Takes All Types,www.takesalltypes.org,ben@takesalltypes.org,,"Blood donation and collection face a variety of challenges.  Fewer than 5% of eligible donors actually donate, and the average age of donors is over 50.  Further, collection operations are local, and therefore necessarily decentralized, and the market is comprised of multiple competitive agencies that all suffer from limited communication with the public - particularly in an emergency.    Takes All Types is addressing these issues by using online social networking to create the first national network to support our blood supply.  Takes All Types founded in December 2007, is a not-profit organization based in New York with prominent Advisory Board members in relevant industries nationwide.  Social Media applications on sites like Facebook and MySpace enable users to register themselves, to opt in, as blood donor volunteers.  Then when a user’s local community needs contributions in order to save a life, the system sends personalized alerts, by text message, phone, FAX and Email, to call them to action!  Users select the communication methods, and may set regular reminders to give regularly.  This more precise and efficient approach facilitates blood donation in a direct, personal way, that engages donors in a grassroots solution to a common problem.  Takes All Types also provides the infrastructure for blood disaster preparedness, as it provides a novel means for immediately mobilizing local donors, by blood type, on a scale commensurate with the need.  As blood is a universal substance, and the Internet is a universal information system, they represent a great match.  Social networks are the ideal venue, as they offer both a high volume of user traffic and real-time communication capabilities.  The applications promote the cause both by their very presence on the sites, and more profoundly through interactions between social peers.  Donors tend to be older citizenry, and social media targets the crucial youth demographic.    This solution is in active use on Facebook and the organization's dedicated website, and will be released on MySpace in the next few weeks.  My abstract was accepted by America's Blood Centers to speak on a Social Media panel at their annual Donor Recruiters Conference (they collect 55% of the blood in North America), and I have a collaborative relationship with the Give Life Foundation.  Takes All Types has been featured in the NY Times, TechCrunch, ABC, CBS and NPR.

41,Rachel,Cheatham,"VP, Food, Agriculture & Nutrition Communications","Virilion, Inc",www.virilion.com,rcheatham@virilion.com,,"Harnessing the power of social media to message credible information on weight loss  Consumers seeking information on weight loss are increasingly turning towards social media in the form of blogs, video-sharing sites, wikis, podcasts and other peer-to-peer communications to inform their approach and seek support.  Stylistically, social media requires a certain level of flourish, an emotional connection and an intentional redundancy of a common message to prompt behavior change.  Such an approach is often seen as incongruent with traditional nutrition science information dissemination.  And yet, with one in every 20 internet clicks going to one of the top 20 social networks and with 81% of “health seekers” finding information through the internet rather than through medical professionals, social media offers the power to message credible nutrition and health science, if utilized skillfully.        This presentation will delineate peer-reviewed versus peer-to-peer social media communication styles, suggest guidelines for using social media to communicate about body weight management as well as document current information available for a “diet information seeker” trolling for information online.

45,West ,Shell,CEO,Healthline Networks,www.healthline.com,czintl@healthline.com,," 170 million people are on the Internet everyday and 80% of those people are searching for health information. Think how much more accurate and meaningful an online health search for a consumer might be if it could return personalized information, automatically generated by the relevant clinical data in the users PHR. This is the “holy grail” for health information technology and why wide-scale adoption of the PHR is the next step toward turning this vision into reality.   But it’s still early, and the challenges associated with a consumer controlled, online PHR definitely remain:  • consumer privacy and security;  • medical accuracy of a consumer-controlled PHR;  • the technical hurdles associated with “networking” the PHR – with doctors, pharmacies, health plans, etc -- to make it informative and actionable for consumers.   The reality is that most healthcare information technology is located on disparate, legacy systems that are not web-enabled. One of Healthline’s core capabilities is that it can mine legacy health information content and data, integrate the information intelligently, and present it to the online consumer. This is what Healthline has done for Aetna and more than 30 other health plans, publishers, portals, providers and advertisers.   For his presentation at Health 2.0, West would like to discuss the challenges associated with (and strategic insights gleaned from) working with a diverse set of more than 30 partners with a common business goal: to deliver relevant health information to consumers in more meaningful ways.  ","Healthline Networks forms the nexus between the Internet health consumer and the businesses that are trying to reach them. As more brands adopt Healthline’s innovative technology platform, consumers will have access to content, tools and clinical applications that transform the health search experience from passive information gathering to active engagement in their health decisions.  Healthline’s product portfolio is already used by leading consumer media brands AOL and iVillage’s Your Total Health to deliver comprehensive online health search results, enabling consumers to quickly and easily get the most contextually relevant information. Similar implementations are expected to roll out to AARP, Rodale and Time Inc.’s Health.com in the coming months.   Healthline also helps medical publishers such as ADAM, Gale Cengage and StayWell simultaneously enrich their content, increase distribution and improve monetization with no additional effort on their part.   For leading health plans such as Aetna, Healthline connects medical data and patient information to offer consumers richer, personalized health information while lowering the plan’s cost of service.  With other health plans such as Regence Group, Healthline will work on information management tools intended to better inform the consumer and lower costs for the insurer.   Healthline Networks now works with the following brands: AARP ADAM Aetna American Society of Health-System Pharmacists AOL Ask Cerner Multum Conde Nast (SELF) DestinationRx DNA Direct Eating Well  Gale Cengage Harvard Health Publications HealthPricer Human Kinetics iVillage’s Your Total Health Info.com Ingenix LocateADoc Omni Medical Search Merck Merriam Webster Mitsui & Company Natural Standard PacifiCare Practice Fusion Quality Health.com The Health Central Network Reed Elsevier Regence Group Rodale StayWell Televox Time Inc.

It is the next step, once the consumer has used Health 2.0 technology and tools.  These experts help people take the knowledge they have and turn it into action.  They must be experts in health issues (content); health systems (navigation); and professional, ethical representation of patients in their efforts to access appropriate healthcare services (advocacy).

Administered by a national program office at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Project HealthDesign’s goal is to design and test a suite of PHR tools and applications that work together to help people achieve their various and specific health goals in an integrated fashion. The program is supported by the Foundation’s Pioneer Portfolio, which funds innovative projects that can lead to fundamental breakthroughs in the health and health care of all Americans.  This bold new program will build on and extend the range of uses offered by existing PHRs by supporting multidisciplinary teams to design and test a broad spectrum of innovations in how consumers can use information technology to better manage their health and more easily navigate the health care system. Project HealthDesign challenges health experts and technology designers to push the envelope in thinking about the transformative potential of PHRs and design PHR systems that can exist on a common platform.  In this two-phased, 18-month initiative, nine design teams will participate in a six-month structured process to create user-centered personal health applications that address specific health challenges faced by individuals and families. In the subsequent 12-month prototype phase, these personal health applications will be tested in target populations.  The program’s objectives are to:      *       Develop innovative designs for PHR products and services that can help individuals and their families manage important health challenges;     *       Generate insight into the needs, preferences and design challenges associated with diverse populations;     *       Develop an initial set of requirements for a common PHR platform that can support a diverse array of applications;     *       Propose solutions to address the ethical, legal, and social issues related to person-centered, person-managed health information, including privacy protection; and     *       Stimulate the health information technology industry to develop consumer-focused personal health records system products and services that use the common platform approach.   Each design team receives a grant of up to $300,000. RWJF is pleased to collaborate with the California HealthCare Foundation, which provided $600,000 in additional funding for Project HealthDesign.

First, on-demand viewers in general actively seek out programming.  Second, on-demand health viewers are viewing specific videos for a particular reason (i.e. watching a video on melanoma because their mother was diagnosed with it).  These viewers are not passively watching programming - instead they are actively seeking out programs.  The growth of consumer-selected video both online and on television creates a new information platform to educate and inform current and potential patients.  Long format disease topic videos presented as “opt in” experiences allow for more in-depth, “3rd party” content than traditional broadcast-oriented video advertisements.  After health professionals, someone with the same condition is most important to consumers seeking advice about particular medications and the care process.     The “stars” of online and cable VOD health videos may be the newest set of KOLs to emerge on the healthcare scene.  A recent survey of online viewers found that 34% of Americans turn to social media for health research. And, half of VOD and broadband video viewers talk to their doctors after viewing a specific title, creating an engaged and action oriented audience. The emergence of the so-called “Consumer Opinion Leader” is an extremely important online heath resource for 2/3 of individuals who go online for health information and a call to action to all social media companies who play in the health literacy space.

Not only can consumers measure and track many fitness activities via dedicated tools, devices and Web sites, integration among these components has accelerated recently, driven by a broad array of social, economic and technological trends and forces, as well as the groundbreaking success of a few non-traditional players entering the market.   While the fitness industry itself has been evolving digital technology working in isolated, single product-centered islands, big players in consumer electronics have identified this industry a major growth area for the next decade. Their bets are placed on growing interests from not only tech-savvy boomers, but also tech-centric Generation Y and an emerging youth fitness segment for which play, sports and technology are tightly intertwined.   The forces of convergence and possible market opportunities are driving the emergence of what Changeist calls ""fitness ecosystems"" – combining a base of traditional fitness equipment with clothing and accessories, media technology, computing and communication devices and eventually intelligent leisure environments into common, cooperative networks of communicating products and services that monitor and encourage the user's fitness and wellness activities. ","With over 15 years as a thought leader, analyst, consultant, writer and futurist, Scott has traveled the globe  monitoring and mapping the convergence of social, technological and economic change. He served as a futurist and director for a Washington, DC-based foresight firm, helping respected brands such as Nokia, Honda, P&G, Kellogg’s and McDonald’s understand and plan for new consumer behaviors and the technologies that will impact their lives in the future. Prior to this, Scott led consumer and business research and consulting practices for the Yankee Group, Current Analysis and Jupiter Communications, in London, Washington, DC and New York, respectively. In these roles, he learned and refined the analytical, pragmatic view of the world that makes Changeist's insights distinctive and valuable today.

It will allow patients to construct self-care and physician interaction strategies based on the successful experiences of others with the same condition.  For vendors and program sponsors, social networking will offer a source of direct consumer feedback that can be used to develop lighter-touch approaches to chronic disease management programs, low cost programs for rare and complex conditions, and greater insights about medical and formulary benefit designs.

Dr. Kardos original equation, Value = outcome/Cost, is based on the principal that that improving health status is the only way to stabilize and reduce health expense. His early pioneering efforts to develop a claims system that assigned benefits at the member level allowed tracking for the first time in health benefit administration of compliance with minimal care standards by members and their physicians.

Experience Project was started out of a personal need when a close friend was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.

Quickly we noticed that patients wanted to connect on their whole selves (not just ""M.S. Patient"" but ""M.S. Patient that is a single mother, lives in Chicago, and loves the Beatles"") and find support from others that were like them and truly understood what they were going through. This hyper-targeted form of support drove engagement through the roof and led our product to grow.  Today Experience Project allows users to anonymously connect about any life topic that matters to them and get support from peers. Health topics are the basis for our main communities (depression, sexual health, anxiety, diabetes, cancer, etc. are all large and active communities), but we also enable users to share more about their lives to be able to get a fuller emotional and psychological support.   We reach nearly 2 million people every month, making us larger than most other health social sites, despite our 'under the radar' approach at launch - a true testament to the product and the passion of our team and users.  We would love to share with the Health 2.0 Community our unique thoughts on social networking on health as well as how to deliver personalized services and support with pinpoint targeting.

This 3-way communication enables the client to work intensively on crafting a personal lifestyle and self-care plan while the Healthguide sends monthly progress updates to the PCP.  When the PCP returns a message of support and advice to the Healthguide and client, s/he is reimbursed by Longitude Health for getting involved in the process.    This is a dynamic way for people with risk factors and chronic conditions (fully 70% of the medical spend in the US) to get ongoing input from their physician while working with a specialist in health improvement, the Healthguide.  Healthguides do not perform medical triage or diagnosis -- they are not practicing medicine -- but rather, extending the reach of the time-strapped primary care physician by provide ongoing support for empowered, effective self-care.

164,Ken,Tarkoff,VP/GM Consumer Solutions,RelayHealth,rwww.relayhealth.com,ken.tarkoff@relayhealth.com,,"Today’s financial market conditions are accelerating the shift in the burden of health insurance costs from the employer directly to the consumer. Struggling employers will no longer be able to provide traditional, high-cost health benefit coverage that has shielded many Americans from the true cost of healthcare services. Additionally, people who lose their jobs may not be eligible for, or able to afford, COBRA and published reports predict another 1.1 million consumers will be without healthcare insurance with each subsequent 1% rise in unemployment. The result: Consumers will become more critical ""shoppers"" for their healthcare needs and it is likely that they will pay their healthcare bills even more slowly than they have in the past.    As consumers are faced with tough financial choices, healthcare will no longer be sheltered from the desire for a good value. To succeed in this environment, healthcare providers must offer greater convenience and self-service options that address payment issues upfront to avoid unwelcome surprises, uncollectible debts and dissatisfied patients.   Compounding these financial challenges, providers are simultaneously struggling with increasing costs to collect the self-pay portions of the healthcare bill, which greatly exceed the cost of collection in the retail sector. Providers are also coping with a surge in medical identity fraud.      RelayHealth has developed key financial connectivity services during multiple points of provider-patient-insurer interaction to address these challenges:  Pre Service:  Consumer accessible online pre-registration accelerates the revenue cycle process by engaging the consumer prior to their arriving for service. This helps to improve pre-service self-pay collection by calculating the patient’s financial obligation for service and their ability to pay.  It expedites the provider’s ability to qualify the patient for alternative assistance programs as well as automating their ability to validate patient identity/ demographics, and credit history.  Point of Service:  Online patient payments simplify and lower the cost to collect patient deposits, copays and deductibles.    Post Service:  An online consolidated presentation of multiple bills from multiple care settings, demonstrates consumer payment responsibilities in an easy-to-understand and simplified format with real-time updates from insurance. When combined with online payment options, providers benefit from faster consumer payments.    System-wide:  RelayHealth estimates that for every paper-based transaction involving patients, physicians, hospitals and health plans, administrative costs can be reduced by as much as 75% when common financial paper process are converted to an electronic service.  This could result in annual savings of billions of dollars to providers every year.             ","Here is some of the ""official bio"" used for me.

177,Jason,Peoples,Vice President,Diversinet,www.diversinet.com,jpeoples@diversinet.com,,"Mobile Health Wallet –   Securing and Authenticating a Mobile Medical Records and Payments Wallet to Meet Healthcare and Financial Regulatory Requirements To meet the needs of consumer driven healthcare there will be a growing convergence between the financial services industry and the healthcare industry to provide consumer’s access to their funding sources such as debit, credit and HSA as well as their medical records. Now Payers and Providers will have to deal with both HIPAA and financial regulations such as PCI, FFIEC, and card association rules to support a consumer healthcare mobile wallet.   Proposed Presentation Summary   Recent initiatives by Google and Microsoft to enter the PHR (personal health record) market has highlighted the role of the consumer in managing their own healthcare. At the same time providers are pushing more costs down to the payers who are subsequently pushing higher costs down to the large employer groups who are in turn encouraging their employees into higher co-pays and deductibles. On top of this, the USA government has allowed personal HSA (health savings accounts) to help fund these escalating costs and they expect that the consumer will have to get more proactive in managing their families healthcare services and payments. There is convergence happening between the financial services industry and the healthcare industry where Payers will have to deal with both HIPPA and financial regulations such as PCI, FFIEC, and card association rules. A secure authenticated mobile health wallet as a platform to address all of the above issues is required as a relief valve and tool for the mobile consumer to manage their healthcare services and payments.                Key Takeaways   The audience will come away with: - How the convergence of healthcare and financial services will effect the development of consumer centric mobile tools  - The role of HIPAA and financial regulations in developing mobile healthcare solutions - The role of mobile generated payments in healthcare - How to secure and authenticate mobile healthcare applications, data and payments   ","Speaker would be Jay Couse:  Biography   Jay Couse is responsible for developing markets for Diversinet’s mobile wallet/vault technology in the healthcare marketplace.

",http://www.simulconsult.com/,segal.m@simulconsult.com  ,,"I’d like to contribute to the Health 2.0 Conference in one of the following ways:  1) Co-Present on Great Debate number five titled “Wiki vs. Expert – What’s the best approach to Knowledge Creation?”: I would like to take the other side of debate number five with Dan Hoch (who is already a selected speaker vs. TBA). Dan and I used to co-teach the epilepsy block of a course at Harvard Medical School when I was on the school’s faculty. Dan and I are very familiar with each other’s work, which will make for an informative discussion. I have recently co-written an invited article for the American Academy of Neurology on “Health 2.0 for Neurologists” (http://www.aan.com/news/?event=read&article_id=5277), which has become the most viewed article on the organization’s Web site. The article highlights Dan’s “patient–patient” efforts, but focuses more on “doctor–doctor” and “doctor–patient” sites, consumer wikis, doctor wikis and even computational wikis (see below). I would be able to provide a very newsworthy first-hand account of how “doctor–patient” sites have been used over the past year to assemble the effort that may by the time of the conference result in finding the first of the ADHD genes and introduction of surprisingly simple treatments and prevention strategies for the disorder. This “doctor–patient” effort is likely to become the prime example of success of patient empowerment through the “doctor–patient” Health 2.0 model.           2) Demonstrating / discussing a Health 3.0 effort: Health 2.0+ is not just about producing content to read, it is about producing databases with which one can compute to answer medical questions. Our American Academy of Neurology article (http://www.aan.com/news/?event=read&article_id=5277) outlines how SimulConsult Neurological Syndromes software is assembled as a peer-reviewed wiki, and used as a resource for diagnosing patients in 60 countries and as an educational tool in resident education in the USA. I can demonstrate how this Health 2.0+ tool collects the wisdom of the community and uses it to help doctors to improve the diagnosis process both in accuracy and cost-effectiveness. ","I am an award-winning pediatric neurologist who has made important research contributions throughout my career to diagnosis and treatment of disease. My passions for health care and computer science led me to where I am today as Chairman and Chief Technology Officer of SimulConsult, the company I founded while on the faculty of Harvard Medical School. SimulConsult was recently featured in The Innovator’s Prescription: A Disruptive Solution for Health Care, co-authored by Clay Christensen and Jason Hwang, M.D., SimulConsult exemplifies Christensen’s concept of disruptive innovation and its benefit to America’s ailing healthcare system. SimulConsult’s database has grown to include the entire spectrum of neurological and metabolic syndromes (more than 20 percent of diseases in all of medicine) and it is widely accepted by physicians in a number of specialties.  I have also been recognized for my research into reproducing the abnormal electrical activity of epilepsy at the level of single cells and single channels as well as for the development of the microisland culture technique that is now a standard model system used to study many brain disorders. I earned young investigator awards for U.S. neurologists and worldwide epilepsy researchers for this research. Recently, I have built on my epilepsy research to characterize a common form of attention deficit disorder that has a pathogenesis similar to epilepsy, and introduced new forms of therapy and prevention for the disease.   I completed my M.D., Ph.D. and residency in Pediatric Neurology at Columbia University in New York and my undergraduate degree with magna cum laude honors from Harvard. I am on the Electronic Communication Committee of the Child Neurology Society and a MD NetGuide Healthcare Advisory Board member.  ",2009-01-23 04:00:22,public,,,12.151.151.19,1,1

","Roger Holzberg became a thyroid cancer survivor almost 5 years ago, but he began learning about health challenges long before then. He became familiar with care-giving at an early age, losing grandparents, a best friend, and his mother along the way, then watching his father become a cancer survivor. He knew it was likely he would someday face a life-threatening challenge himself. A year after radiation, as a competitive triathlete raising money for those less fortunate, he learned that the only way to complete a race that is too big to imagine is to break it down into imaginable pieces, set small goals along the way with the help of your Team's experience and guidance, and take the first step. This family history and approach to challenges became the foundation of My Bridge 4 Life.  While working as creative executive at Walt Disney Imagineering, he began to share the program with others in need, and it worked, well!  A year ago he left Disney to create My Bridge 4 Life.  Professionally, Roger creates world-class experiences that utilize new technology channels for the delivery of emotionally compelling narrative and retail products. Recent clients include: Lucas Arts, Keas, Livestrong, Methuselah Foundation, and Tula Health.

202,Steve,Brown,CEO,3banana Inc.,http://3banana.com,steve@brown2020.com,,"Health 2.0 Makes Information Therapy Possible  Health 2.0 for the first time makes Information Therapy practical and possible. Health 2.0 is about individuals creating and sharing more of themselves online in a way that improves their own health, the health of others they are connected to, and the health of the community as a whole. Information therapy is based on the idea that what we think and believe -- the content of our minds -- can influence our health, either directly or through our behavior, and that we can change and influence the content of our minds and therefore also our health through information media. Personalized health, however, is infinitely diverse, and if we had to design the right information therapy for the right person at the right time, we would never finish the job. So how does Health 2.0 make information therapy possible? The needs in health care are so diverse, so complex, so personalized, and so rapidly changing, that information therapy derived from a scripted template cannot fully address the diversity of needs. Without Health 2.0, the greater the number and diversity of people with health needs, the more infinitely complex the situation becomes. Health 2.0, on the other hand, changes the information therapy equation. Because the participants also are co-creators, selectors, navigators, recommenders, and reviewers of content, the more people involved the greater their diversity, the more possible it is to meet everyone’s needs. While some traditionalists might argue about evidence-based information, the reality is that rich and diverse Health 2.0 communities are also enabling an acceleration of evidence gathering and controlled research to generate new knowledge about how information therapy works and what works for whom, so that we may truly learn how the right information can be given to the right person at the right time to improve health.  ","20 years ago, I founded Raya Systems, the original information therapy company. We used the Super Nintendo video game system as a platform to treat chronic illness with interactive media, changing what children believed about their ability to cope with their disease, and a result actually changing medical outcomes. We were well before Health 2.0, and the content was all designed and developed by our team together with experts, creating a carefully crafted user experience with one rule of law for our role playing game world in which we could use the child’s motivation to conquer the video game to as the drug delivery device for our information therapy. We programmed game scenarios and game worlds to build a child’s confidence and self-efficacy in balancing food and insulin to manage diabetes, or to manage asthma medication and asthma triggers. Although far less sophisticated than the latest Hollywood hits, it was still a solid year of development by a dedicated team.  Health Hero Network, my next company, got its start about 10 years ago, providing a platform for that enabled nurses to coach and monitor patients at home over a network from a remote location. Health Hero Network was a Health 1.5 platform in theory, because rather than dictating all of the content for all of the conditions, our strategy was to provide the tools to the nurses and care managers enabling them to create their own content for their own programs.  Because care management programs had such a diverse range of needs, many programs were needed. Where it used to take a team a year to produce a program for one condition, now 30 programs could be produced in a fraction of the time and expense. As a result, we had programs for dozens of diseases and over a hundred permutations. Still, the information therapy was highly scripted, based on what the authority, this time the care coordination staff, believed was right for the situation.  Bosch acquired Health Hero Network in late 2007. Realizing the inherent limitations of designing the information therapy script for all of healthcare, I went to Mohr Davidow Ventures to start to explore social media, which I thought might have the keys to personalized health and information therapy. At this time I also had the chance to help create a successful Health 2.0 community for new mothers at Breastfeeding.com. What started as an information site turned into a thriving community of users who supported each other in a myriad of unexpected ways, helping each other learn and cope with the challenges of being a first time parent. The diversity of needs, situations, styles and thought was so great the no one could possibly predict it and no editor could possibly have designed and planned all the right content. Such content can only emerge from the community. At the end of 2008, we sold Breastfeeding.com to The Knot, a publicly traded life stage media company.  Convinced of the power of social media to change our relationship with the people and ideas around us, I have stayed involved in social media. 3banana is my new venture, a mobile applications company which aims to reduce the friction between the thoughts, experiences, and ideas in our heads and the systems and services in the cloud that can help us remember and share those ideas with other people and services.

Unlike PHRs and EMRs that are massively complex and take months, if not years, to implement and use effectively, the focus of ReliefInsite remains on creating disease and condition specific trackers (diaries) that take only minutes to complete, require none of the healthcare providers time, and yet provide details essential in diagnosing and treating a patient.

It starts with advanced clinical protocols and scripts developed for the company by leading U.S. medical and academic institutions using evidence-based best practices for a range of chronic conditions. These currently include asthma, diabetes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure.  The protocols are customized according to the specific health needs of the targeted patient population. Scripts can be provided by GenerationOne or by a disease management company.  Medical reminders to take medications, test blood glucose levels, check their weight, blood pressure, etc. are delivered to patients via the GenOne H-Phone, which is optimized for delivery of medical information, or their own personal cell phone with compatible technology. Depending upon the disease in question, patients may also be prompted to respond to a series of questions designed to evaluate their current health status.   The patient responds using the phone’s key pad.

We would like to launch our national findings at your event.    The annual National Progress Report on E-Prescribing tracks national electronic prescribing activity through the Surescripts network between 2006 and 2008. The report emphasizes growth related to three critical steps in the e-prescribing process – prescription benefit, prescription history and prescription routing.   The report contains key statistics, electronic prescribing use, electronic prescribing adoption, key drivers of e-prescribing in 2008, and actions needed to support the growth of e-prescribing.  The annual National Progress Report on E-Prescribing was created to better inform and support efforts aimed at helping to drive the overall adoption and use of this critical technology. It provides a summary of key statistics detailing the status of e-prescribing adoption and use in the U.S.  ","The National Progress Report on E-Prescribing is published each year by Surescripts®. By electronically connecting thousands of prescribers, pharmacists, payers and software vendors into the country’s largest, standards-based e-prescribing network, Surescripts is able to provide a detailed analysis of e-prescribing in the United States.   The Surescripts network is the backbone that facilitates e-prescribing – a proven process that reduces healthcare costs, improves patient safety and increases systemic efficiency. To utilize the Surescripts network, a prescriber, pharmacy and PBM must use software that has completed the Surescripts certification process. This process ensures that the software is able to send and receive electronic messages in accordance with the industry standards and that it is providing open choice for medication selection and dispensing location. Surescripts provides prescribers with access to prescription benefit information and patient prescription history and securely routes prescriptions from the prescriber to the patent’s pharmacy of choice.  As a private sector solution created and operated by the nations’ leading pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), the scale of the Surescripts network -- and the growth in e-prescribing -- are evidence of the speed and effectiveness that can be achieved in bringing digital solutions to the U.S. healthcare system’s challenges.  Further, the company’s leadership closely collaborates and provides guidance to national, state and regional health IT initiatives by sharing first-hand experience, statistics, research, case studies and best practices.  Surescripts is the result of a 2008 merger between the country’s two leading health information networks: RxHub and SureScripts. RxHub was founded in 2001 by the nation’s three largest PBMs – CVS Caremark Corporation, Express Scripts, Inc. and Medco Health Solutions, Inc.

We'd like to do a presentation re: translating evidence into practice -- the process of taking what we know, and turning it into what we do.    A lot of our clients and potential clients in health care are sitting on mountains of good research (what we know) complaining that few providers ever read their white papers, and just keep doing things the same old ineffective ways.  We propose that communication between research producers and research consumers (providers, medical staff, patients, the general population) is severely limited by the prevailing model of dissemination: Information is pushed out through academic papers and professional conferences and publications, all of which are extremely exclusive in terms of who may access the information -- AND in terms of who may understand it. The formal and even tortured academic style of communication in all these forums cries for translation -- translation into visual, auditory and interactive media that engages more providers, more patients, and more stakeholders in disciplines outside health care, enabling them to respond to research and more actively shape the direction of research in the future.  We propose a number of means by which we might produce a ""free market"" exchange of ideas between producers of evidence (researchers) and consumers of it (providers, health care workers, patients and the general public).  Our company is positioned to address the use of multimedia for sharing ideas and best practices, and for demonstrating behaviors and processes that must be seen and heard to be learned.  We believe multimedia communication, offered through a platform (technological or institutional) that facilitates ongoing communication and feedback among producers and consumers of information, is needed to accelerate the evolution and impact of health information.

Central concern: Real world reactions to how social media impacts the physician-patient relationship. For example, at the Spring show there seemed to be an impulse among vendors and patient empowerment advocates that physicians don't want empowered patients. Most I know would love it if their patients would control their own health. In fact, their big fear about outcomes-based pay is that they will be on the hook for poor nutrition/medication decisions their patients make. Many love when patients read up on their disease, but don't love when patients come in with medical names for their symptoms that, it turns out, are not really their symptoms at all. This needs a balance at Health 2.0. Most healthcare in the US is provided in small (less than 5 docs) practices. We can't just write them off as old-school. In short, vendors tend to assume too much about physicians. Having a few in the room -- both those currently deep in 2.0 and those on the fringe will help keep the meeting real. At the least, I can be a stand-in for such concerns.","I am one of a handful of nationally branded/recognized practice management experts in the country.

If a GlowCap is not opened at medication times, it then reminds patients through phone calls, email and SMS text messages and can be programmed for up to four dosage times per day. GlowCaps have the ability to leverage social networks by sending adherence reports to physicians, caregivers and patient’s support systems, offering individuals, pharmaceutical companies, retail pharmacies, and hospital systems a simple, secure, and cost-effective way to lift adherence. GlowCaps are designed especially for managing chronic diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and depression where daily medications are critical for long-term health.   David has recently developed the Adherence-based Pricing Plan, which was created because most medication adherence solutions focus on reminding people to take pills and ignore the influence social and financial components have on behavioral change. Taken together, social and financial incentives have a stronger long-term effect on adherence than simple, daily reminders. GlowCap connectivity enables Vitality and its partners to track patient adherence rates and develop new pricing models based on that information. Vitality’sAdherence-based Pricing is designed to provide cost-effective incentives that increase adherence rates and reduce overall expenses related to non-adherence by rewarding patients for consistently taking their medications.

Over the last few years the traditional thinking about innovation has been turned on its head. We used to assume that innovation was driven by access to the most advanced tools and resources, but the emphasis has shifted more recently to the role that scarcity plays in driving innovation. This change has inspired belief that healthcare innovation will emerge from the bottom up, out of developing markets. But is that really the case?   In this presentation Vice President of Creative, Robert Fabricant will explore frog design’s efforts to propel healthcare innovation in developing markets. The presentation will use the case study of Project Masiluleke to examine how leveraging mobile technology can build connectivity between resources, patients, and doctors in the healthcare system. Project Masiluleke, (http://www.frogdesign.com/services/project-masiluleke.html#/images/project-m-gallery_1.jpg)  is the first ever attempt to tackle the HIV epidemic in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa with a mobile solution, starting with a single text message to 1 million phones. The voicemail and text messaging campaign helped to triple average daily call volume to the National AIDS Helpline, encouraging more than 150,000 people to reach out for information.   Robert will explore this complex dynamic between scarcity and abundance in the healthcare system. In this case -when a culture dominated by resource scarcity (like KZN) is confronted with an abundance of different resources (mobile networks and social capital.)  Examining the case study of Project Masiluleke, which uses the cell phone as a bridge to treatment, will reveal the increasing phenomenon of leveraging telecommunication to (re) connect patients with medical resources and experts.

New medical technologies have fueled the transition from intuitive to precision medicine, allowing previously complex disorders to be diagnosed precisely and treated with predictably effective therapies. When these innovations are integrated into new business systems, they will spearhead vital reforms in the healthcare industry.","Dr. Jason Hwang, M.D., is co-founder and Executive Director of Innosight Institute, a non-partisan, non-profit think tank which applies the theory of “disruptive innovation” – originated by Harvard Business School’s world-renowned innovation strategist Clayton Christensen, also a co-founder of Innosight Institute – to develop solutions to some of the most vexing problems faced by the public sector. Disruptive innovation describes a process by which a new product or service that initially only attracts the lowest-end consumers in a market moves relentlessly “up market” and displaces established competitors. The theory reveals how to make successful innovation predictable – a critical responsibility for today’s health care information leaders.  Dr. Hwang, who leads the Institute’s health care practice, builds on Christensen’s lifelong study of innovation processes to reveal that the problems of high cost and inaccessibility aren’t unique to health care – similar problems have characterized the early stages of literally every modern industry. Therefore, just as the process of disruption has transformed those industries, it can make health care services and products affordable and conveniently accessible. Dr. Hwang describes a viable solution for reducing costs, increasing affordability and minimizing the economic impact of health care. He details his findings in “The Innovator’s Prescription: A Disruptive Solution to Health Care” (McGraw-Hill, January 2009), also co-authored by Christensen. You may also be interested in the major feature story from Managed Care Magazine that explores the core themes of the book: “Disruptive Innovations That Will Change Your Life in Health Care.”  http://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/0901/0901.disruptive.html   An internal medicine physician and former chief resident at the University of California, Irvine, Dr. Hwang has received multiple recognitions for his clinical work. Previously, Dr. Hwang was a Harvard Business School Fellow at Innosight, Clayton Christensen’s innovation consulting firm, and he has also worked with the Health Horizons Program at the Institute for the Future, a forecasting think tank.

Furthermore, 85 percent of hospitals, ambulatory clinics and physician office practices have yet to automate their care processes. Why? The answer lies not in technology offerings, but in the proprietary, closed software business model that fails to service adequately the mainstream health care marketplace.  The Open Source business and development model, on the other hand, offers health care an opportunity to transform itself and deployments now live across the country support this hypothesis. This session will explore how the acceptance of the open source business model across other industries -- from Linux, Redhat, MySQL and Jboss just to name a few -- have resulted in more affordable, more stable, more secure and more customizable software systems now being leveraged for healthcare. The session will go on to examine the standard-bearer in open source healthcare IT, the Veterans Administration's clinical open source information system and electronic health record (EHR), called VistA, and how this technology has helped take the VA's health system from ""Worst to First"" in quality healthcare. A proven, successful and highly interoperable system developed over the course of more than 20 years, VistA has been used by close to 65 percent of all physicians during their VA training rotations. Finally, this session will introduce attendees to new, commercially-supported and enhanced solutions based on VistA, released in open source and now available to healthcare organizations across the country, as well as examples of hospitals using this technology and the benefits experienced.

267,Aaron ,Blackledge ,Medial Director/ Founder,Care Practice Urgent & Primary Doctors,carepractice.com,Aaron@carepractice.com,,Practice Innovations ,"I would be interested in participating in the conference in October. I wanted to touch base early before we launch our full PR push later this summer so you are at least slightly aware of us.  I am the founder of Care Practice Urgent & Primary Doctors located in San Francisco.  I had worked for Current Health for 18 months before leaving with a few other doctors in January 2008.  In September 2008 I opened Care Practice in Mission Dolores as a fee for service medical clinic and house call service.  It is in part based on the micropractice model, but adapted to a large urban group practice setting.  I starting with zero patients in late September 2008 and have grown to 3 doctors and almost 2 thousand patients.  My next physician, that will start later this month is Dr Vinh Ngo, who was one of the original Carena House Call physicians in San Francisco before they closed their Bay Area operations in August.  Another Doctor with my group is Dr Carolyn Cooper who left Current Health in January of this year to join me at Care Practice.  In just 8 months we have grown exponentially and have expanded to have staffed office hours 7 days a week and risen to the number one ranked urgent care in San Francisco on Yelp.com and the number 2 ranked Family Medicine Clinic.   I guess I would be considered one of those odd sorts that wanted to build my infrastructure and team before I pushed the media and PR fronts.  I really viewed media as a distraction to building my unique model and besides that I recognized through past work experiences that Big media exposure does not necessarily translate into patients walking in the door.     Well thanks for your consideration, keep an eye out for us as I finally get some time away from seeing patients every day to start talking to people about the unique things we are doing at Care Practice and why they have been so successful.  http://www.yelp.com/c/sf/urgent_care   You may notice in this link also The House Doctor here in San Francisco.  We work very closely with that micropractice and share patients frequently. He also worked at Current Health/ San Francisco On Call for almost 3 years before leaving around the same time I did in 2008.

271,Maren,Connary,Co-Author,The Design of Electronic Clinics (book),www.eclinicdesign.com,maren@marenconnary.com,,"The Design of Electronic Health Clinics  DESCRIPTION Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have been around for almost a decade and are gaining traction, but at an adoption rate below 12% in US hospitals. However, an EHR is just one component of an electronic care delivery system called an Electronic Health Clinic (EHC). This talk will illustrate best practices for EHC design, user experience design, and the proper relationship between EHRs and EHCs.   ABSTRACT The Mayo Clinic was the first institution to implement paper health records in the late 1800s, they were also first to implement Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) into their clinical system about a century later. During this period both private and public institutions began designing and developing their own EMR systems, which in turn created widespread incompatibilities, lack of standardization, and functional failures. These issues and the fact that EHRs have been improperly prioritized over patient care continue to hamper progress in developing successful Electronic Health Clinics (EHCs).  A better way to approach the issue of online care delivery is to first build an EHC and then integrate the EMR into the system. Approaching the EMR as a component and focusing on customer experience though interaction design and strategic information architecture allows project teams to deliver a far more pleasant, effective and repeatable clinical experience.  This talk provides and overview of the electronic healthcare industry, why progress has been slow as well as some best practices used when designing EHCs - from working with the appropriate development model to building components such as sessions, profiles, scheduling and billing.   ","This talk will be presented by Adam Nedelman and Maren Connary:  ABOUT ADAM Mr. Nedelman’s background is primarily rooted in the as a user experience designer in the field of healthcare. He spent 10 years in administration working as a billing manager, moving to the position of clinic supervisor in mental health; in Pain Management at UCSF/Mt. Zion. Adam then moved to the Pain lab where he became the research lab manager, and later to dentistry as a division administrator at UCSF. These positions spanned from 93-03. Post UC Adam worked on the digital design team at Psychology Online as a lead designer for their online mental health clinic. Later he returned to UCSFs medical informatics group as lead designer for the patient portal project and the SFGH positive health program. During this time at the UCSF MIG Adam attended the Stanford Clinical Informatics program in order to better grasp the current state of e-health, problems with systems, benefits to patients, and the progress in transition from paper based-electronic based health care.   Concurrently, over the past 10 years Adam has worked as a user experience designer and information architect. His positions span working with UCSF, Sapient, eBay, Genentech and Eveo as an Information architect, experience architect, user experience designer, and user interface designer.

Powerful messaging features help facilitate communication between the members of the health system and an automated alert system helps reduce gaps in treatment.  RapidResponse currently supports the Community-Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) protocol, Malaria diagnosis support and basic clinical diagnosis including lab results.  RapidResponse is currently being piloted in Sauri, Kenya and is aimed at reducing mortality rates in children under five.

The needs of a young married couple trying to get pregnant are different than the needs of a retiree who is a diabetic which are different than the needs of a family with pre-teen children.  Yet today, every Member Health Portal provides the same content, applications, and experience to every user, regardless of their circumstances or need.    Organizations today are hand-cuffed by years of legacy backend constraints that force an Inside-Out approach; i.e. Portals deliver what is “possible” instead of what is “required”.  But as web-savvy consumers gain greater control of their healthcare plans in an increasingly competitive environment, Healthcare Portals need to step up and deliver the best content, the best user experience, and the best online self-service to win and retain customers. Organizations need to shift to an Outside-In approach of providing users with what they need as individuals, regardless of any technology or infrastructure constraints.  The Backbase Next-Generation Portal allows Healthcare organizations to innovate and transform their Online Channel to best meet the needs of their Business and their Customers – all while working around existing technology and infrastructure constraints -- this is our ""secret sauce"".

We now see remote monitoring systems and the ability of mobile devices to provide solutions where patients can take their readings anywhere and immediately share them with their healthcare provider.  At its core, good healthcare is about the relationship between an individual and their doctors.  Family and friends compliment this core relationship to form an extended care and support networks. The rise of social networking is redefining the notion of on-line presence and fundamentally changing how people collaborate and interact with each other. In this demonstration we will show how connected health solutions will become more effective by integrating physical device readings with a patient’s own support system, as realized through social networking technology. We will show an example “Telehealth Mashup” that illustrates how composite applications can be used by healthcare professionals to provide more effective care by being able to tailor their “view” of a patient. We will also demonstrate how a person can enable their on-line social network to become an “extended care network” so that their “friends” can actively participate in their overall care. This creates a personalized “network effect” with gives health care providers a more holistic view of their patient’s well being.

315,Ryan,Phelan,CEO,DNA Direct,www.dnadirect.com,mark@dnadirect.com,,"DNA Direct delivers guidance and decision support for genomic medicine.  The company’s comprehensive clinical programs are unique to genomic medicine and combine proprietary technology with genetic expertise, including a national call center of genetic experts, web-based applications, and educational resources and training.  DNA Direct’s solutions help patients and providers better integrate genomic medicine into healthcare decisions and help healthcare payors manage the growing costs and complexity of genetic tests.    Over the past five years, DNA Direct has established a foundation in genetic expertise by helping individuals and providers identify if tests are appropriate and interpret complex test results in the right context.  This platform is used by major healthcare providers such as El Camino Hospital, who partnered with DNA Direct to create a Genomic Medicine Institute that provides comprehensive web- and phone-based genetic expertise resources to physicians and patients across five medical specialties.  Most recently, DNA Direct has partnered with Humana to deliver a comprehensive genetic testing management program.  Healthcare payors face two key challenges related to genetic tests – how to manage growing genetic test utilization trends and how to ensure improved clinical outcomes based on genetic information.  Healthcare payors currently spend $1.5B annually on genetic testing technologies and see annual growth rates in utilization as high as 70% for some high-cost, complex diagnostics.  Because genetic tests are reimbursed using generic CPT codes, healthcare payors have limited visibility into which tests are being ordered and why; however, several health plans report that they believe up to 20% of genetic tests are ordered inappropriately.  Additionally, while genetic testing holds much promise for improving the precision of medicine, capturing the value of genetic information requires that tests are ordered, interpreted, and acted on appropriately.  However, most physicians lack formal training in genetics, making it difficult to ensure appropriate clinical integration of genomic medicine.  To address these challenges, DNA Direct offers two core solutions to healthcare payors:   1.Utilization Management Programs. The company’s utilization management program helps health plans identify the appropriate tests for individuals, avoid unnecessary costs of inappropriate tests, and gain visibility into test utilization.

325,Robert,Nease,Chief Scientist,Express Scripts,"Express-Scripts.com, Consumerology.org",Rnease@express-scripts.com,,"The sustainability of healthcare benefits hinges on effective means for nudging better behavior on the part of both patient and physicians.  Growing evidence makes it abundantly clear that financial incentives alone won’t motivate these changes. Despite record-low prescription trend in 2008, for example, the United States wastes $42 billion each year due to underutilization of therapeutically equivalent, low-cost generic drugs. Now more than ever, plan sponsors cannot afford economic waste –- spending more, but not getting more.  Fortunately, behavioral economics is arming us with new insights about human behavior, with practical applications in healthcare. One particularly powerful approach is choice architecture.  When applied correctly, choice architecture makes the obvious thing to do right.  (This is in distinction to education and decision support, which typically attempt to make the right thing to do obvious.)  Early applications of choice architecture in healthcare are surprisingly effective.  For example, more than two dozen Express Scripts’ clients have implemented a program called Select Home Delivery, which nudges people to mail order delivery of medications for chronic conditions. As a result, plans employing the program are enjoying a near tripling in the use of this more cost-effective delivery channel, with millions in savings expected this year.  Because these results are achieved without the use of financial penalties or changes to plan design, Select Home Delivery is the most popular program in the history of our company.  It is crucial for healthcare payers to continue to explore why people make the decisions they do. This enables us to improve management of healthcare without changes to copayments or plan structures –- which eases administration of all benefit plans and is particularly important in a managed care environment, where such changes are often not feasible.","Bob Nease joined Express Scripts in 2001, bringing with him a wealth of experience in medical decision making and scientific research.

327,Miriam,Paramore,SVP Corporate Strategy & Public Affairs,Emdeon,www.emdeon.com,mparamore@emdeon.com,,"Note:  At Jane Sarasohn-Kahn's suggestion, I emailed this proposal to Matthew and Indu but wanted to also submit it through the website for the sake of completeness.  PANEL:  “Cats vs. Dogs” PERSPECTIVE from an Information Intermediary:  I agree completely with Matthew Holt’s sentiment that health IT does not reform a healthcare system, it only supports what it is plugged into.  However, I also believe passionately that information is a key lever in health reform, and a critical component of a reformed system.  Information is needed to measure outcomes, to create incentives, to overhaul any part of healthcare, and to keep stakeholders honest over time.  Information that is trustworthy, understandable, and consistent will empower us as consumers to make sense of our complex healthcare environment while managing our own health. Before there can be “data liquidity” that empowers the consumer, there has to be digital data.  First we have to get it off paper and out of human-readable form and turn it into digital, in machine-readable form.  Then we need to share it among all of the computers across healthcare so that there is something called a patient-centric longitudinal electronic health record.  And then, we need to give a copy of that record to the consumer, only translated into something that a normal person can understand.   But we’re getting ready to solve that problem in a meaningful way, $17.2 billion times over, right?  The health IT stimulus will put an EHR in every doctor’s office and – presto! – we’re there, right?  Wrong. As we herd the cats and dogs of health IT for this panel, the unique perspective of the information intermediary should be included in the conversation.  For over 25 years, information intermediaries have allowed those who want structure and proven technology (cats) to communicate effectively, even to unify, with those who want the freedom of proprietary systems and the newest tools (dogs).  Information intermediaries offer a place where cats and dogs come to make beautiful music together.  (Yes, that was an intentional sentence that mashes together two different analogies from Matthew Holt’s January 22, 2009 blog.)   The fact is that the healthcare marketplace will never be at a level of complete IT parity, any more than the United Nations will chose one world-wide language. Rather, the healthcare market will continue to require an independent and universal translation service, and this need will increase as more paper-based data becomes digital via stimulus funding.  Some may consider the information intermediary an outmoded concept, blaming “clearinghouses” as money-grubbing vendors whose intention is solely to ensure that healthcare stakeholders remain isolated and stuck in their own languages.  In truth, the national health information network (NHIN) vision requires such intermediaries, it just calls them something different.  Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) are a re-do of the Community Health Information Networks (CHINs) of the 1990s, which were themselves an attempt to create a data exchange mechanism between multiple healthcare trading partners.  Today, Dr. Halamka and others will testify that most, if not all, of the financially sustainable HIEs are based, at least in part, on the tried-and-true administrative clearinghouse model of the 1980s. And the consumer?  Unfortunately, the consumer participation in this harmonious symphony of data liquidity is still a little further down the road.  The clinical information exchange needed to create a patient-centric longitudinal EHR, and then ultimately a PHR, will be the end-state but there are many meaningful steps between here and there.  Fortunately, the industry has learned something about ubiquitous, interoperable information exchange from the administrative side of the market, and those lessons can be applied to clinical HIE, and ultimately will serve the consumer well.  What the Audience Will Learn: •History of health information exchange models – from the clearinghouses of the 1980s, to the CHINs of the 1990s, to today’s HIEs and the NHIN •The role of standards across the ages – from the “National Standard Format” of the 1980s, to HIPAA in the 1990s, to the abyss of clinical standards needed for clinical HIE today •Why consumers are STILL left out of the health IT stimulus, as meaningful use is focused solely on providers proving what they do to consumers and if they should get paid for it •What the geeky weirdness of ANSI X12, HL7, NCPDP, NUBC, NUCC, HITSP, LOINC, SNOWMED, and more is absolutely necessary ","As Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Public Affairs for Emdeon, Miriam Paramore is responsible for long-term strategic planning, government affairs, corporate communications, and strategic social responsibility programs.

I dropped out of Stanford and went on to a career in illustration for archaelogy site maps.  This led to training in Geographic Information Systems.  Eventually the mapping of the human genome matured and at the same time web-based Geographic Information Systems became capable of visualizing massive datasets.

339,Peter,Hudson,"CEO, MD",Healthagen,www.healthagen.com,phudson@healthagen.com,,"Healthagen is dedicated to empowering patients through technology to be better informed about their health and medical conditions and to improve their decision-making process about when and where they seek treatment.  The company has an application called iTriage which is available on the iPhone, through .mobi Internet browsers on mobile devices and very soon on the web.  The application has been featured in the NY Times and other major media (http://tiny.cc/o9mUP).   The company was founded by two ER doctors who, after seeing 50,000 patients between them, realized that patients often were woefully under-informed about their conditions or injuries and were arriving at the ER when urgent care or a retail clinic or even a call to a nurse at their insurer would have sufficed.    They also intuited that ERs were spending significant fees to specialists to camp out in their ERs, but lacked any means to communicate that specialist's presence to prospective patients when they most needed it, at the time of an injury or serious illness.  And insurers were groping for some educational platform to direct  patients to appropriate care facilities, saving potentially millions of dollars and ultimately getting patients more suitable care and saving them money in the long-term.  Healthagen's principal product, iTriage, solves these issues.  Patients with an injury or illness simply identify symptoms and access information on that condition and then, by either inputting their zip code or allowing a mobile device’s LBS technology to identify their location, a series of local facilities comes up.  That listing (whether an urgent care facility or a pharmacy clinic or an ER) may have a premium listing and therefore have additional information like hours of operation or specialists on call, or, like the yellow pages, simply have the address and phone number.  The application will also discern which facilities are most appropriate, always allowing for the extreme but ensuring the most cost-effective and time-efficient option is also offered.  In other words, if the patient determines through the app that he or she has a twisted ankle, a retail clinic option will be suggested, along with urgent care and an ER.  But, if it looks like a torn Achilles’ tendon, then only an ER would come up as an appropriate option.  The company CEO, Dr. Peter Hudson, is a frequent public speaker and I am sure would contribute to any suitable panel.

As a panelist, Martin will be prepared to discuss the current state of electronic medical records and what is still needed to make them useful from payer groups to consumers. In addition, Martin can speak to how Health 2.0 tools in conjunction with value-based health care plans can: - Identify potential health risks early on - Encourage members to share information with their physician  - Provide richer benefits for following health guidelines  - Incent members to maintain good health - Convince members to take advantage of their benefits plan rather than the traditional insurance approach, which seek to limit claims   Janice Rahm on behalf of Martin Watson","Martin Watson is CEO of HealthInsight, a healthcare technology and services provider dedicated to reducing the cost of healthcare by improving the health of individuals.

As CEO of HealthInsight (a technology developer for next-generation health records) and SeeChange Health (the first new health plan to be introduced in California in the last 30 years), Martin can bring to light the idea of value-based health care – a concept that, with the right technology, can address the linchpin for health care cost reduction by driving patients and physicians to accept their respective responsibilities to stabilize health expenditures and use existing information, new technology and responsible medical actions to achieve better health at lower cost.  HealthInsight and SeeChange together not only encourage patients to have greater insight and control of their personal health information, but also rewards them for taking an active role in managing  their health. The more plan members follow preventive and condition specific guidelines, the less premium they pay - the more physicians do to meet current care guidelines, the more valuable the physician becomes to patients and their sponsoring health plans.   With the advent of this kind of easy-to-use communication pathway for patients and physicians that was previously unavailable, health plans and EMRs will now supply trusted information to align physicians and plan members so they can take appropriate steps for better health.

Will be glad to provide sneak peek to the committee!>,paulto@emota.net,408-757-6318,"Dear Health 2.0 Committee:  I am applying for a demo spot for the Emota product.  I am also interested in being commentator on topics relating to aging and elderly care.  We all think about our elderly loved ones all the time, but face-to-face meetings or even phone calls may be few and far between due to distance, busy schedules, etc.  Wouldn't it be great if we could share the moments of our lives as easily as we could when we all lived under the same roof? Emota is a new kind of emotional and social networking platform designed to help busy and remote families stay connected, involved and helpful in the lives of their aging loved ones.   There are four main groups that we aim to serve:  1. The Elderly - Research has shown that just a small increase in perceived social and emotional support results in a large reduction of disease risk in the elderly.  Seniors have increasingly  attempted to use the Internet and social networks to connect with their loved ones, but social networks are often too complex for them.  Emota provides a simple, low effort, and non-intrusive communication method to help busy families and their elderly stay in touch and aware of each other, enabling seniors to age in place.   2. The Family Caregiver - Family caregivers provide more than 75% of caring support in our society today.  The financial and emotional burden to individuals, families and society is huge. As many as 50% of family caregivers show signs of depression and face a higher risk of heart disease.  Emota is an emotional and social support platform to help family caregivers communicate status and needs to friends and family. Emota’s unique “Nudge” technologies help caregivers coordinate care activities by intelligently nudging the right family member to perform the right care action at the right time.  3. Friends & Family - Emota provides a continuous Peace-of-Mind solution for busy families who are concerned about their loved ones.  Emota's Facebook and iPhone applications help family members ""keep an eye"" on their loved ones by providing alerts if certain concerning conditions  are detected, such as lack of activity, signs of depression, etc.  The Emota system will ""nudge"" family members into taking necessary and meaningful actions to support the elderly and their caregivers.  4. Healthcare Provider - Emota serves as a key partner to healthcare providers, in their quest for ""Consumer Centered Healthcare"".  Emota allows healthcare professionals to ""plug-in"" to the patient's friend and family support circle, and help in the emotional and physical care of the patient. Emota helps keep the elderly cognitively, socially and emotionally engaged, which can significantly reduce health risks and costs.  Through the use of Emota's Nudge technologies, healthcare professionals can also monitor and encourage medication compliance and clinical adherence.   Thank you very much for your consideration.  Please feel free to contact me at:  Paul To CEO & Founder Emota.net 408-757-6318 paulto@emota.net ","Paul (me) is CEO & Founder of Emota. Emota’s mission is to apply the latest research in ambient intelligence, awareness systems and emotional communications to help in the care of the elderly and their family caregivers. Emota’s team is comprised of top Health 2.0 innovators, interaction designers, social anthropologists and scientists including Richard Sachs and Karen Herzog of Sophia's Garden Foundation, Jeffrey Ventrella of the MIT Media Lab, Dr. Michael Carter of Digital Media and Learning - MIT Press, and Dr. Ted Selker of MIT & CMU who is one of the top scientists in the field of Contextual Computing and Human Computer Interface.  Prior to founding Emota, Paul was in charge of Nortel's Incubator and its Open Innovation programs.

355,Hamid,Tabatabaie,President/CEO,lifeIMAGE,www.lifeimage.com,hamid@lifeimage.com,617-775-0438,"Hi Indu, Matthew & Lizzie,  I'd like you to consider a discussion on the need for innovation in medical image sharing. Why? Because diagnostic imaging is one of the most expensive components of healthcare, yet patients and their referring physicians *still* don't have a convenient way to access, store or share medical imaging exams or reports. I think it's time to talk about giving patients ownership of their imaging histories and Health 2.0 is an ideal venue to do so.   Even further, I would welcome an opportunity to show the audience the universal imaging Inbox that my company has developed. It is part of a service that will allow patients to actively participate in and manage their personal medical imaging histories. The service is launching to providers this October (in 'alpha' at a Boston hospital now) and after a few more releases this winter will be officially extended to patients in August 2010.   Our vision is that regardless of the type of imaging exam (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, etc), the site performing it (a hospital, clinic, imaging center, etc.) or the vendor that designed the imaging system (GE, McKesson, Fuji, Philips, AMICAS, etc.) patients should be able to aggregate studies in a personal, highly-secure online location. The lifeIMAGE Inbox will let patients indefinitely access, store, and share their medical imaging information with the healthcare providers of their choice and also track their personal radiation exposure. Patients who suffer from chronic diseases that require frequent imaging have no choice but to accumulate and track piles of CDs from various providers. The lifeIMAGE service will make image management as easy as online banking.   Discussing this problem and demonstrating the lifeIMAGE service as as solution at Health 2.0 will undoubtedly encourage much needed conversation on the lack of patient access to medical imaging. Thank you in advance for your consideration and please do let me know if you need more information.   Regards Hamid ","I have been in healthcare industry for twenty-five years and in that time I have led four successful HIT startup companies, the last of which was AMICAS, the largest independent radiology automation company.

First we are probably be going to work to release one or more drug databases under FOSS licenses, as well as maintenance releases on those databases. This is going to allow for people to circumvent the 'FirstData tax' when building Health 2.0 applications. We are planning on allowing access to this both as a download and as a web service, both at minimal cost-to-operate fees and with FOSS redistribution rights.  We will be working to release more data sources in a similar fashion, but drugs make the biggest splash.  Second we will be releasing a series of FOSS code that will serve as starting points for mashups of these new FOSS data sources, and traditional web-services. These snippets will be both for demonstration purposes and to enable bolt on feature additions to current Health 2.0 applications. We will be promoting libraries that is intended to provide a unified meta-interface to HealthVault and GoogleHealth, so that you can code to both at once.  We will also be offering a new 'Doctor Verification' Federated Authentication system using SAML and OpenID. Essentially this web-service will allow you to trust that a user has proven that they are a clinician. This will allow sites to create physician only sections to web sites and web applications. For instance, you could create a wiki with a wiki page for every doctor in the United states and then ensure that it each page was only accessible to the doctor in question. Or you could enable doctor responses to a doctor review site, knowing that the right doctor was responding.  Essentially we will encouraging the development of new Health 2.0 applications by providing both unique FOSS code and web-services providing FOSS data that will lower the price point and difficult of producing a Health 2.0 application.  Using our services and code a single developer could probably replicate what it would have taken an entire company to produce just last year....  If Google is the prototype Web 2.0 company then its enabling technology platform is Linux project, GNU/Linux runs all of its public facing servers.

Currently at our second of three-phases of our development, we have completed our online Health Professional Web Platforms (TM).  These platforms allow a health care professional to sign up for a fully functional website platform that they get to modify/add pertinent details without any technical skills and use those platforms to attract new patients to their practice or (in the coming months) interact with their current patients/clients.

The USA is debating the introduction of universal health coverage while Canada is discussing problems and solutions to its universal system.  A significant problem in Canada is that the system is inflexible.  Despite this, there are some limited ways to introduce more personal supplemental services which give patients more choice.  Some of these solutions can be directly patient funded although they often get demonized by the those who want to protect the status quo.  Canadian doctors and patients are gradually accepting the inevitability of these extra fees, but a major practical problem is that there are no good payment and collection processes for these patient funded services.  Therefore many doctors either avoid providing them or give them away free in a limited way.   I'm developing a better system to help physicians provide more of these services and to streamline the payment process.  The aim is to provide grassroots physicians with the tools to help extend their relationships with patients without the cumbersome and often fruitless process of negotiating new payment from the government(which would be analogous to insurance companies in the USA).  This will allow for a wide variety of primary care doctors to foster a more responsive, customized, and flexible relationship with their patients.

Participation rates for consumers in health programs and providers in adoption have lagged without incentives. Every major employer, government and health plan initiaiitve includes incentives to consumers and providers to drive cost reductions.   IncentOne's Health Power solution is an integrated incentive solution in which individuals (consumers or providers) earn incentives for various health activities (e.g., obtaining a mammogram, e-prescribing) and can use their incentives for their choice of rewards from:  • Non-Monetary Rewards (e.g., gift cards from hundreds of national retailers, merchandise)  • Monetary Rewards (premium reductions, co-pay, HSA/HRA transactions, cash)  • Health Rewards (e.g., glucose monitors)  • Personal Services   Because IncentOne's technology is program, milestone and reward independent, it enables the adminsitration of virtually any health incentive program.

Since then, there have been a steady stream of news reports, commentary and blog discussions pointing to the slow pace of health information technology or “HIT” adoption and questioning how much it can improve outcomes, reduce cost and increase efficiency. As these reports point out, making HIT “work” is not as simple as it sounds.   One company has successfully navigated these challenges: Surescripts, the country’s largest health information network.    Surescripts is the backbone behind the much touted growth in electronic prescribing or “e-prescribing, but it’s much more than that.  The company is based on a different model entirely, one envisioned and built by industry to serve doctors and patients.  By putting aside competitive differences and creating a commercial free, level playing field, the nation’s pharmacies and payers were able to create a nationwide network for e-prescribing and sharing health information. With support and collaboration from the nation’s software vendors, physician groups and federal and state policymakers (providing critical guidance on standards and offering incentives), this corner of nation’s HIT efforts are flourishing –  improving the safety, quality, cost and efficiency of a process relied upon by millions of patients in the U.S. every day.     To explain how HIT will truly change U.S. health care Harry Totonis, president and CEO of Surescripts, can speak with authority on how HIT is already changing health care and how lessons from creating and running Surescripts serve can ensure that this change expands to impact and improve the healthcare system overall.   Harry Totonis is the president and chief executive officer of Surescripts. An executive with extensive experience in information services and a track record of running successful network-based businesses, Totonis joined Surescripts in March of 2009.  Prior to Surescripts, Totonis was head of Advisors Services at MasterCard, the professional and information services arm of MasterCard Worldwide. While at MasterCard, Totonis expanded the company into decision analytics and information-based products. He was responsible for a global team that spanned business development and sales, product innovation, technology development and customer delivery. During his tenure, Totonis developed and executed the strategy for Advisors Services’ and MasterCard’s information and analytics services – a board level initiative – while expanding service offerings and streamlining operations. This resulted in significant overall revenue growth and substantial increases to revenue and net income per employee for Advisors Services.  During 14 years with Booz Allen Hamilton, Totonis focused on strategy consulting for large global companies across network-intensive sectors including technology, processing, consumer banking, insurance and airlines. He served in several executive positions, including managing partner of the firm’s global banking and insurance practice and as a member of the firm’s executive leadership team. His clients included Visa International, American Express, IBM, JPMorgan Chase and others.  Prior to MasterCard, as CEO of Kinexus, Totonis led the development and growth of a private banking network that enabled banks to share information and deliver better financial advice to their customers.

Our Vision: At the center of the healthcare reform debate is the skyrocketing cost of healthcare and how to rein it in. A possible cost control and quality improvement driver for healthcare would be to empower the patient to partner with physicians to focus on prevention prior to needing expensive cure. While technology has made great strides in the clinical and medical device aspects of healthcare and emerging in EMR, however the application of the latest advances in social media or smartphone technologies are yet to make deep inroads in improving the quality of care or patient experience as many other industries have undergone transformation leveraging automation and collaboration to reduce cost and improve quality.  More people now use the Internet as a source of health information than their personal physicians (59 % versus 55% in a recent study). However, quantity and varying quality of information on the Internet raises its own problems. Patients may have to spend considerable amount of time on Internet only to get totally overwhelmed by sheer volume of information requiring synthesis. In frustration, they may revert to what they had always done, forget the Internet and see their physician which only increases the total cost of healthcare. On the other hand unless patients are knowledgeable to proactively manage their health, many preventable diseases are not treated on time leading to mortality and higher cost of cure. Support networks of patients with same or similar conditions are valuable sources of information. However, 77 % of elderly have multiple chronic diseases. Imagine having a fairly common combination of conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high lipids and low thyroid and trying to put together a plan using the Internet. Also, our goal should be to prevent such illnesses in the first place. However, creating a health maintenance plan through Internet will be even more daunting because of large number of preventable illnesses. Our solution leverages computerized social networks or SmartPhones to enable patients to be active partners and collaborators with their caregivers, medical professionals and other stakeholders in health including insurance companies, government and the society.

411,Brian ,Beutner,CEO,mPay Gateway,mpaygateway.com,brian.beutner@mpaygateway.com,612-326-7794 ,"mPay Gateway would like to demonstrate it's core product, a a web based health care software credit card payment system that secures payment from patients before they leave the office.    In three simple steps, this product enables a health care provider to calculate what the patient will owe, obtain the patient’s authorization, and later collect from that patient without ever sending a bill. The calculate, validate and collect steps will more fully be detailed through the following screens within the demonstration:   1. Open patient encounter (through various mechanisms – card swipe, prompt from practice’s existing practice management system, pick from pre-scheduled encounter list, or manual look up) 2. Confirm benefit plan and other information about the patient (automatically fed from the practice’s existing practice management system) 3. Enter services performed (automatically received from practice’s existing practice management system) 4. Swipe card for patient authorization 5. Obtain patient signature 6. Prepare and submit insurance claim in normal course, a horribly complex process outside the mPay Gateway systems that all practices currently do  7. After receiving the remittance advice from insurer detailing the exact amount patient owes, hit the “collect” button on mPay Gateway’s payment screen to settle funds.  mPay Gateway is the only service that is focused directly on the patient payment obligation. Others in the health care IT space combine patient payment tools with other health care technology, such as eligibility look up, claim creation and submission or EDI services.   mPay Gateway’s simple process allows health care providers to reduce their bad debt by 50% or more with a minimum of process change in their practice.   The mPay Gateway product’s impact stems from the relative ease of adoption compared to the dramatic change in the financial performance of the practice. The “Wow!” factor comes from the eye-popping results our customers report – 50% drop in receivables, 75% drop in statementing costs, 100% gains in collections. The difference between using mPay Gateway and continuing to push along the old way of collecting the increasing patient payment obligation is the difference between thriving as a practice and not surviving at all.  ","mPay Gateway™ was established in 2004 on a foundation of entrepreneurial success by former executives of companies that pioneered technology to support transactions between health plan sponsors and payers. mPay Gateway represents the culmination of years of leadership and success in both financial services and health care technology.  This is our founder’s (Mark Tierney) third successful health care IT start-up and brings financial service acumen to the health care industry.

After working with beta sites for most of 2008, mPay Gateway has nearly quadrupled the number of customers under contract in the first months of 2009. ",2009-09-22 03:01:35,public,,,66.41.32.137,1,1
