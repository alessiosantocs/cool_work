www.EpiHelp.com 							November 5, 2009
EpiHelp is a smart patient health record (smart PHR) which not solely banks information but provides aggregated user knowledge (crowd sourcing). EpiHelp will further down the road be reseller for health products on the internet. EpiHelp even challenges Obama’s expectations on health IT: “Health IT will help save jobs and lives and billions of dollars.” In fact EpiHelp cannot only provide information for the community (individuals and patient help groups) but also support its B2B customers in saving and developing multi-billion dollar streams by understanding, engaging and educating patients/health citizens/consumers and marketing superior health care products.  

 
Picture 1: Schematic overview of EpiHelp

EpiHelp empowers the patient in a worldwide, multi-ethnic and cross-border network that allows for finding appropriate diagnosis, treatments and resources very effectively for any disease or medical search request based on user data analysis and certified data in a portal solution. EpiHelp will generate extremely relevant information through tagging, web2.0 tools and its related database. EpiHelp can be described as “the largest continuous, multi-variable medical observational study ever” and thus creates an immeasurable value for patients, medicine and industry. The most powerful and effective tool in medicine has always been observations or “Epidemiology” as seen in the long lasting and unparalleled medical treatment successes in Chinese medicine.


 
Picture 2: Display of qual. - and quantitative information stemming from consolidated user entries
EpiHelp has an unmatchable social cause and supports the inevitable shift towards massive consumption power in health care, our vision is to match the consumer power conversions in medicine like Amazon and EBay realized shifts in commerce.  
EpiHelp is consulting with several administrations in an effort to supporting decrease of the financial burden on public health care spending while increasing the care for its people. Health Plans and the health industry can use EpiHelp for reimbursement decisions, to increase efficacy and for product marketing - thus revenue generation through increased patient compliance. With EpiHelp comparative effectiveness research (CER) becomes available for any discipline and treatment in a standardized fashion for everybody. As a result EpiHelp is highly relevant for Organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center of Disease Control (CDC), the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ), the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the German Institute for Economics and Quality in Health Care (IQWiG).
From a scientific prospective it is apparent that crowd sourcing technologies like EpiHelp will establish in the marketplace as their findings are most accurate, timely, diverse and adaptive. 




EpiHelp is a for-profit start-up company that will provide smart PHRs for free to the end user and will resell patterns into the industry and products to the consumer. 
Early benches in this market are www.patientslikeme.com and www.curetogether.org.

It delivers media to you based on how you feel with the intention of causing an emotional shift. For some, this may be experiencing less stress or becoming more focused. For others, perhaps it’s feeling more inspired or being less fearful. 

Pepfly matches media (pep) to your current “inner status”. It invites you to describe how you feel in everyday language and then delivers a variety of media, such as photos, videos, text and interactive exercises, intended to boost wellbeing. From a library of media that is constantly being refreshed to reflect the best of society, pepfly brings you media to help you feel positive emotion, think constructively, and do the things that are important to you.      

Pepfly uses a psychology recommendation engine to recognize the words you use to describe yourself and make sense of them in psychological terms. It uses a matching algorithm to connect your psychological state to a piece of media that might work for you. It uses a learning system to find patterns in your ratings so that it can deliver more of what works for you and less of what does not.

Veer is Director and Co-founder of Humanity Calls. Humanity Calls is a social fundraising platform that enables people to promote and collectively vote for the most deserving nonprofits and in turn allocate a pool of donated funds. There are more than 1.9M registered nonprofits in the U.S. alone. Yet many would-be donors give little or nothing despite a sense of social obligation and a desire to give back somehow. This exacerbates the struggle for nonprofits which incur great expense trying to break through the noise. Meanwhile, individuals and large corporate donors suffer a burden having to sift through the noise to find “right” cause(s) or organization(s) to support. 

>>> By incorporating such concepts as internet voting and a host of viral marketing and online engagement techniques, HC represents a new model which enables individual donors to support nonprofits with micro and even non-monetary contributions. This, in turn, drives the growth of an engaged, passionate online community, which nonprofits may then lobby for greater support at no, or much less, expense than traditional marketing activities. Finally, HC provides large scale corporate donors with two significant opportunities. The first is to donate to a model with the potential to provide greater “impact-per-dollar” than other fundraising platforms. This is made possible by HC’s system of leveraging corporate donations to drive individual contributions downstream. Second, HC allows corporations to outsource the burdensome task of determining where to donate. With HC, corporate donors rely on HC’s community to identify the best and most deserving nonprofits of the moment through ‘crowdsourcing’ and democracy.  

Veer was CEO and Co-founder of Control-F1 which was an industry leader in Support Automation. Control-F1 had over 100 customers worldwide, 50 employees and raised ~$13M in venture capital. Veer started Control-F1 in the midst of completing his degree in business at the University of Western Ontario. In December of 2005, Control-F1 was acquired by CA, one of the world's largest software companies with over $4B in sales. Veer most recently served as Executive Advisor to the Executive Vice President responsible for CA’s business units. Prior to that he was head of sales for CA’s Service Management business, overseeing ~$75M+ in revenue. 

Veer is Director of Neurosilicon and a founding investor. Neurosilicon is a life science company that is focused on advancing healthcare research through enabling rapid, non-invasive, targeted depolarization of excitable cells using the company’s novel photoconductive stimulation technology.

Veer has been named to Maclean’s ‘Top 25 Under 30’ and was a finalist for the E&Y Entrepreneur of the Year award.

Prior to CiviGuard & SU, I was comfortably nestled in the field of ""rocket surgery""  - the point at which medicine & tech collide. Previously, I have published papers on telemedicine for the developing world, a book chapter on space spin-off technologies for medical benefit and work in clinical neuroscience. I also conducted pre-clinical and early clinical testing for neuroArm, a neurosurgical robotic arm based off CanadArm technologies and worked with the Crew Medical Support Office at the European Astronaut Center in Germany.

My book, “The Future of Medicine – Megatrends in Healthcare,” was written based on interviews with over 150 leaders from across the country on what to expect as advances in medicine in the coming five to fifteen years. Since its publication I have done the research for a sequel, also interviewing over 150 individuals [doctors, nurses, hospital executives, insurance company leaders, health care consultants, etc] to gauge what the delivery of medical care and the hospital of the future will be like in the coming years. 

Combined, this information would make a compelling 20-30 minute background/setting talk for your conference. 

I will be happy to send you a copy of “The Future of Medicine – Megatrends in Healthcare” along with a very short DVD that introduces the topic in return for an address. No obligation provided that you do not complain that I chose to spell healthcare as one word for the title.

Meanwhile you can get an overview at www.medicalmegatrends.com 
","","","","","Stephen C. Schimpff, MD is the retired Chief Executive Officer of the University of Maryland Medical Center and author of “The Future of Medicine – Megatrends in Healthcare.” It discusses the scientific advances in medicine such as genomics, stem cells, vaccines, medical devices, imaging, the operating room and information management. He is writing a sequel on the “hospital of the future” and the changes coming in the delivery of medical care. The book demonstrates how physicians and hospitals must and will change to accommodate. It addresses how healthcare reform will impact the delivery of medical care into the future (http://medicalmegatrends.blogspot.com ). Dr Schimpff also teamed with Dr Morton Rapoport to write “Alignment – The Key to Success of the University of Maryland Medical System.” It describes the 25 years since the University of Maryland Hospital was separated from state ownership and university governance and grew from a struggling single hospital to a very successful nine hospital system.

Dr. Schimpff, an Eagle Scout, graduated from Rutgers University and Yale Medical School where he also did his internal medicine residency. He then completed medical oncology and infectious diseases fellowships. He is Board certified in Internal Medicine, Medical Oncology and Infectious Diseases.

Dr. Schimpff was at the National Cancer Institute for 13 years caring for patients with acute leukemia and lymphomas and conducting research into the serious infections that occur in these patients. He was appointed a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland Medical School where he was head of Infectious Diseases and director of the University of Maryland Cancer Center. In 1985 he became Chief Operating Officer of the University of Maryland Medical System and in 1999 the CEO of the flagship University of Maryland Medical Center. He is also a professor in the University of Maryland School Of Public Policy.

Dr. Schimpff was chair of the Board of Governors of the National Institutes of Health’s Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center from January 1999 until 2003; he was a board member since its inception in 1996.  

Dr Schimpff gives frequent lectures on the future of medicine and healthcare delivery. He  is a consultant to the United States Army, Battelle Memorial Institute, Booz Allen Hamilton and is on the board of directors or the scientific advisory board of four developing medical device or information systems companies. He recently served on a Congressionally-mandated panel to examine whether the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the Fort Belvoir Army Medical Center would be “world class” when completed in 2011.

The underdeveloped item at Health 2.0 may be the dramatic transformative clinical relevance of connecting Health 2.0 user-generated content to the wider health care system.
The traditional medical model relied on prevalent health to equate to “normal” health of crowds. This paradigm is completely outdated as the US majority became 66% overweight or obese (read highly prevalent no longer has anything to do with desired or optimal health). 
The Health 2.0 user generated content effort is precisely the key to pulling us out from under the ineffective paradigm of “ normal” and delivering real-time adaptive access to optimal. User-generated content (more than expert-generated content) will be the key to transforming the health of crowds sustainably. We demonstrate (using examples)  how current employee wellness efforts (instructional models) are underperforming and how the Health 2.0 (participatory model) will generate a quantum leap in ROI for large self-insured employers.

The health strand aims to tackle underlying causes of poor access and poor management of illness which can arise from distrust and misunderstanding of faith related issues. 

Maslaha will provide greater understanding to healthcare workers about how Islam can touch on all aspects of a Muslim patient’s life and how they can use this knowledge to encourage patients to lead healthier lifestyles, better manage illnesses and long term conditions as well as helping to gain the confidence of their local Muslim community.  For many Muslims, Islam is a way of life that influences not only moral actions but also daily practical decisions. By using Islam you are using a tool that resonates with Muslim patients on a physical, emotional and spiritual level. This multi-pronged approach can then be strengthened by the way the information is presented.

Our work in health is strongly guided by an underlying principle of engaging and working closely with those directly involved in service delivery – community practitioners, nurses and patients – to gain valuable insight and create resources that can have a significant impact. Maslaha uses a wide range of tools in an innovative way to effectively bridge gaps in communication and understanding, including websites, film and printed material.

CaringBridge makes it easy to communicate health news and receive support, all in one place. The burden of keeping everyone updated is lifted off the patient and caregiver because they are able to post a message on their private website for their loved ones to see, instead of making phone call after phone call repeating the same story. Patients and caregivers call it therapy to be able to write about their experience. They also feel so much support when they can see messages from their family and friends all in one place.

The service is 100% free to healthcare providers.

We have achieved significant traction with both our customers (drug manufacturers) and our users (more than 7,500 registered pharmacists and physicians) with an innovative solution that puts the healthcare provider at the center of the prior authorization process-not the health plan.  

Our patent-pending technology implements a web-service that can communicate with clients such as our AJAX-based website (http://www.covermymeds.com), and with claims processing systems. Soon, we'll be able to interoperate with EHR systems as the first company we know of to use NCPDP's new Electronic Prior Authorization Standard.  Our technology is able to encode both the semantics of the Prior Authorization Rules, and various output formats in a way that has scaled to many thousands of distinct PA forms.

The strategy with which we brought this product to market was also innovative.  In contrast to the common ""big bang"" approach to healthcare interoperability, we have built a system that seamlessly moves back and forth between digital and paper; based on each organization's ability to work with data.  This avoids the chicken/egg problems so common in healthcare IT.  We think that healthcare IT adoption can be accelerated by taking this pragmatic approach, and that more health 2.0 startups should think about how they can support the ""lowest common denominator"" in addition to their high-tech data pathways.","","","","","Matt Co-Founded CoverMyMeds in 2008.

Today, the web is the most powerful branding tool available. The web provides more access to branding opportunities than ever before with extremely low barriers of entry.  The share of adult internet users who have a profile on an online social network site has more than quadrupled in the past four years – from 8% in 2005 to over 40% today.  Facebook for example currently has in excess of 350 million active users on a global basis with 50% of active users logging into the site every day.

One to question the traditional approach, Adam’s reputation for being a trailblazing serial entrepreneur has led to business success and an amazing outlook on life.  Similar to former NBA star Michael Jordan, the quote “I can accept failure, but I can’t accept not trying” is the approach he incorporates into his personal and business life.  

In 2002, while attending the University of Southern California Adam co-founded All In Enterprises, a company that monetized poker brands, personalities, video games, cell phone applications, events and online gaming sites.  Adam was a force behind branding the poker-market, as we know it today. 

 Adam continued his string of successful ventures with his launch of Total Package Sports Management, a national sports agency representing over forty professional baseball players including the likes of Evan Longoria, Casey Fien, Jerry Blevins and Aaron Cunningham among many others.  Word got out about his furious poker face and rapid growing success as a branding expert and Adam’s idea of combining fresh marketing and branding approaches to athletes led to TPSM being absorbed by the marketing firm XTS Global. 

With his roots in marketing, sports and gaming, in 2009 Adam founded The Brand X Group where he currently resides as President.  The Brand X Group is a brand management firm whose focus lies on a comprehensive approach to the marketing side of business growth.  Taking advantage of the opportunities presented by today’s various media platforms and technology, the Brand X Group works with clients to deliver a message to their intended audience in the most swift, efficient and cost effective manner.

Empower educates users about the fundamentals of CBT through an experiential, personalized web based user interface.

The code and application can be found at http://www.codeplex.com/nodexl.  Technical questions can be asked on our discussion boards on the Codeplex site at  http://nodexl.codeplex.com/Thread/List.aspx

Using NodeXL it is possible to create social network maps of any topic discussed in a range of social media spaces and systems.  Since health and wellness topics are major topics of discussion, NodeXL can provide realtime maps of public discussions, offering insights into issues and perceptions around a range of health related topics.

NodeXL requires Office 2007.  Other versions of Excel (like 2008 on Mac, or the older 2003) do not work with NodeXL (sorry!).  NodeXL works but is not completely tested against the new Office 2010 version of Excel.  If you do not have a recent copy of Office you may find it useful to know that a free (till June 2010) beta version of Office 2010 is available from Microsoft. The older Office 2007 is also available for a free 60 day trial from Microsoft.

A video tutorial for NodeXL can be found at: http://www.connectedaction.net/2009/11/11/video-using-nodexl-to-map-the-digg-mentioning-twitter-population/

Social Media Network Research Related Publications
In the Journal of Social Structure: “Visualizing the Signatures of Social Roles in Online Discussion Groups” is available from: http://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume8/Welser/  It illustrates different patterns of network structures associated with different kinds of roles and behaviors.

Social roles in online discussion forums can be described by patterned characteristics of communication between network members which we conceive of as ‘structural signatures.' This paper uses visualization methods to reveal these structural signatures and regression analysis to confirm the relationship between these signatures and their associated roles in Usenet newsgroups. Our analysis focuses on distinguishing the signatures of one role from others, the role of “answer people."" Answer people are individuals whose dominant behavior is to respond to questions posed by other users. We found that answer people predominantly contribute one or a few messages to discussions initiated by others, are disproportionately tied to relative isolates, have few intense ties and have few triangles in their local networks. OLS regression shows that these signatures are strongly correlated with role behavior and, in combination, provide a strongly predictive model for identifying role behavior (R2=.72). To conclude, we consider strategies for further improving the identification of role behavior in online discussion settings and consider how the development of a taxonomy of author types could be extended to a taxonomy of newsgroups in particular and discussion systems in general.

“Discussion catalysts in online political discussions: Content importers and conversation starters“ in the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication (JCMC) http://jcmc.indiana.edu/ at http://ping.fm/7NF5T 

This study addresses 3 research questions in the context of online political discussions: What is the distribution of successful topic starting practices, what characterizes the content of large thread-starting messages, and what is the source of that content? A 6-month analysis of almost 40,000 authors in 20 political Usenet newsgroups identiﬁed authors who received a disproportionate number of replies. We labeled these authors ‘‘discussion catalysts.’’ Content analysis revealed that 95 percent of discussion catalysts’ messages contained content imported from elsewhere on the web, about 2/3 from traditional news organizations. We conclude that the ﬂow of information from the content creators to the readers and writers continues to be mediated by a few individuals who act as ﬁlters and ampliﬁers. 

Analyzing (Social Media) Networks with NodeXL
Smith, M., Shneiderman, B., Milic-Frayling, N., Rodrigues, E.M., Barash, V., Dunne, C., Capone, T., Perer, A. & Gleave, E. (2009),""Analyzing (Social Media) Networks with NodeXL"", In C&T '09: Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Communities and Technologies. Springer.

Abstract: In this paper we present NodeXL, an extendible toolkit for network data analysis and visualization, implemented as an add-in to the Microsoft Excel 2007 spreadsheet software. We demonstrate NodeXL features through analysis of a data sample drawn from an enterprise intranet social network, discussion, and wiki. Through a sequence of steps we show how NodeXL leverages and extends the broadly used spreadsheet paradigm to support common operations in network analysis. This ranges from data import to computation of network statistics and refinement of network visualization through a selection of ready-to-use sorting, filtering, and clustering functions.

Whither the Experts
Howard Welser, Eric Gleave, Marc Smith, Vladimir Barash, Jessica Meckes. “Whither the Experts? Social affordances and the cultivation of experts in community Q&A systems”, in SIN '09: Proc. international symposium on Social Intelligence and Networking. IEEE Computer Society Press.

Abstract: Community based Question and Answer systems have been promoted as web 2.0 solutions to the problem of finding expert knowledge. This promise depends on systems’ capacity to attract and sustain experts capable of offering high quality, factual answers. Content analysis of dedicated contributors’ messages in the Live QnA system found: (1) few contributors who focused on providing technical answers (2) a preponderance of attention paid to opinion and discussion, especially in non-technical threads. This paucity of experts raises an important general question: how do the social affordances of a site alter the ecology of roles found there? Using insights from recent research in online community, we generate a series of expectations about how social affordances are likely to alter the role ecology of online systems.

First Steps to Netviz Nirvana
Bonsignore, E.M., Dunne, C., Rotman, D., Smith, M., Capone, T., Hansen, D.L. & Shneiderman, B. (2009), ""First steps to NetViz Nirvana: evaluating social network analysis with NodeXL"", In SIN '09: Proc. international symposium on Social Intelligence and Networking. IEEE Computer Society Press.

Abstract: Social Network Analysis (SNA) has evolved as a popular, standard method for modeling meaningful, often hidden structural relationships in communities. Existing SNA tools often involve extensive pre-processing or intensive programming skills that can challenge practitioners and students alike. NodeXL, an open-source template for Microsoft Excel, integrates a library of common network metrics and graph layout algorithms within the familiar spreadsheet format, offering a potentially low-barrier to-entry framework for teaching and learning SNA. We present the preliminary findings of 2 user studies of 21 graduate students who engaged in SNA using NodeXL. The majority of students, while information professionals, had little technical background or experience with SNA techniques. Six of the participants had more technical backgrounds and were chosen specifically for their experience with graph drawing and information visualization. Our primary objectives were (1) to evaluate NodeXL as an SNA tool for a broad base of users and (2) to explore methods for teaching SNA. Our complementary dual case-study format demonstrates the usability of NodeXL for a diverse set of users, and significantly, the power of a tightly integrated metrics/visualization tool to spark insight and facilitate sensemaking for students of SNA.

Do You Know the Way to SNA?: A Process Model for Analyzing and Visualizing Social Media Data
University of Maryland Tech Report: HCIL-2009-17

Abstract: Voluminous online activity data from users of social media can shed light on individual behavior, social relationships, and community efficacy. However, tools and processes to analyze this data are just beginning to evolve. We studied 15 graduate students who were taught to use NodeXL to analyze social media data sets. Based on these observations, we present a process model of social network analysis (SNA) and visualization, then use it to identify stages where intervention from peers, experts, and computational aids are most useful. We offer implications for designers of SNA tools, educators, and community & organizational analysts.

Bio 

Dr. Marc A. Smith

Chief Social Scientist
Connected Action Consulting Group
Marc@connectedaction.net  
http://www.connectedaction.net
http://delicious.com/marc_smith/ 
 
Marc Smith is a sociologist specializing in the social organization of online communities and computer mediated interaction. He founded and managed the Community Technologies Group at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Washington and led the development of social media reporting and analysis tools for Telligent Systems.  Smith leads the Connected Action consulting group and lives and works in Silicon Valley, California.  Smith co-founded the Social Media Research Foundation (http://www.smrfoundation.org/), a non-profit devoted to open tools, data, and scholarship related to social media research.
 
Smith is the co-editor with Peter Kollock of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity; interaction and social order develop in online groups. Along with Derek Hansen and Ben Shneiderman, he is the co-author and editor of Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a connected world, forthcoming from Morgan-Kaufmann in July 2010 which is a guide to mapping connections created through computer-mediated interactions.

Smith's research focuses on computer-mediated collective action: the ways group dynamics change when they take place in and through social cyberspaces. Many ""groups"" in cyberspace produce public goods and organize themselves in the form of a commons (for related papers see: http://www.connectedaction.net/marc-smith/). Smith's goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structure, dynamics and life cycles. At Microsoft, he developed the ""Netscan"" web application and data mining engine that allows researchers studying Usenet newsgroups and related repositories of threaded conversations to get reports on the rates of posting, posters, crossposting, thread length and frequency distributions of activity.  Smith applied  this work to the development of a generalized community analysis platform for Telligent, providing a web based system for groups of all sizes to discuss and publish their material to the web and analyze the emergent trends that result.  He contributes to the open and free NodeXL project (http://www.codeplex.com/nodexl) that adds social network analysis features to the familiar Excel spreadsheet.  A tutorial on social network analysis is evolving into a book and is freely available (http://casci.umd.edu/NodeXL_Teaching).  NodeXL enables social network analysis of email, twitter, flickr, www, facebook and other network data sets.
 
The Connected Action consulting group (http://www.connectedaction.net) applies social science methods in general and social network analysis techniques in particular to enterprise and internet social media usage.  SNA analysis of data from message boards, blogs, wikis, friend networks, and shared file systems can reveal insights into organizations and processes.  Community managers can gain actionable insights into the volumes of community content created in their social media repositories.  Mobile social software applications can visualize patterns of association that are otherwise invisible.
 
Smith received a B.S. in International Area Studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an M.Phil. in social theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a Ph.D. in Sociology from UCLA in 2001. He is an affiliate faculty at the Department of Sociology at the University of Washington and the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.  Smith is also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Media-X Program at Stanford University.

"67","Eric","Peacock","General Manager","Insider Pages","http://www.insiderpages.com","Eric.Peacock@citygridmedia.com","","4159133160","Team Finder

Insider Pages has been squarely focused on building an offering that makes it easier for people to find great health providers near them that meet their needs (meaning, they come highly recommended for their specialty, accept your type of insurance, have a clean record, etc.). Why? Because Health Insurance Web sites, where people would logically go to find this information, do a very poor job at providing this data. Insider Pages made it’s first move to address this problem (and it’s first major foray into the health space) in May with the launch of Doctor Finder.  Doctor Finder (http://www.insiderpages.com/doctorfinder) is a unique tool that puts all this information in one easy to find place. Essentially, Doctor Finder combines patient reviews with board certification and official malpractice and sanction records to help patients find a new doctor. Users can sort potential doctors by specialty, insurance carrier, gender, locality, ratings and years of experience. 
 
Doctor Finder was a good first step, but there’s a lot more the web can do to help people find the best health care providers.  For our demo, we’d like to show the audience the next step in building out more useful resources on local doctors and specialists – one that focuses on helping people with specific chronic diseases or conditions find and assemble their entire team of health care providers.  We are calling it Team Finder.
 
What is Team Finder, how does it work?

The first thing you discover when you start speaking with breast cancer survivors, parents of Autistic children, parents of children with diabetes, and patients of many other chronic diseases – is that these patients enlist not just one health provider, but many.  They assemble a team to tackle and live with their disease, and often a team to recover from the therapy. What Insider Pages will be launching this fall is a set of disease focused centers in health that allow people to look for and share their teams.  This will be possible through a number of partnerships with major disease organizations, like the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Susan G. Komen, and Autism Speaks, to reach the patient bases. For example, Insider Pages will be building out Autism Specialists pages for every city / region that could pull all of this information into one place and be a good spot for parents of Autistic children to share and find referrals on specific providers who have made a difference in their lives. And unlike other “doctor finders” - the team may actually have many non-MDs involved like therapists, dieticians, personal trainers, alternative medicine providers and more, as we know that patients employ many traditional and non-traditional methods for treatment and recovery.
 
We would love to demo this for the Health 2.0 audience (and could give a very quick demo of Doctor Finder to provide context for Team Finder). We’re happy to provide any additional information, demos, etc. to show you how we’d make this an exciting and interactive component of your show.

This application can proactively divert avoidable ER visits to either urgent care centers or PCP offices, saving costs and providing higher quality care.  If the patient feels these times are not fast enough, they can use the app to forward clinical information in a continuing care document to a participating ER.  When they get to the ER, the location-based technology will identify them and the app will push to the ER physician, the patient's pharmacy, laboratory, radiology and current problem list.  Even if the patient does not activate the app on the way to the ER, the technology will sense real-time that the patient is in a participating ER and the medical management team can reach out to the patient the following morning to reconnect them to their PCP, thus reducing multiple visits to the ER.

"72","Emma","Douglas","PR representative","M*Modal","http://www.mmodal.com","edouglas@knbpr.com","","2036046903","M*Modal’s unique Speech Understanding technology is a combination of software and processes that convert physician's spoken dictation recordings into meaningful clinical documents that capture not just the narrative of dictation but also the embedded medical facts such as vital signs, medications, allergies, and problems.  Essentially, a physician speaks into a single-device (i.e. smartphone, iPhone or microphone) and narrates the patients condition, tests that need to be run, results, etc. The words are not only recognized by the system but understood and then coded for specific medications, allergies, etc. 

The demo would utilize the M*Modal interface and the company's chief scientist would act as the physician, narrating into the system about his encounter with a patient. Viewers would see the technology recognize and understand what was being said, would fill in the appropriate windows of information, code the correct information and fill in the overall narrative - all without additional aid from a transcriptionists entering the information through a keyboard. 

To better explain, the speech recognition technology is able to understand the meaning (speech to facts) of spoken words instead of simply capturing words (speech understanding). By combining recognition and understanding in a single unique technology process (“speech understanding”) M*Modal achieves a new level of accuracy and quality for both automatic speech recognition and natural language understanding. 
","","","","","M*Modal is based in Pittsburgh, PA, and offers on-demand conversational documentation services, or, perhaps more exciting - Speech Understanding technology, that helps healthcare providers capture discrete clinical information from dictation to generate complete and timely electronic medical records.

Although situated within a massively consolidated market, M*Modal remains purely focused on healthcare speech technology.  Our speech understanding solutions remain focused on the complex needs of hospitals and physicians, going far beyond the speech recognition technologies that change the radio station in your car or help you compose a text message on your cell phone.

In a few simple steps, mPay Gateway enables a physician to calculate what the patient will owe, obtain the patient’s authorization to charge a credit card, and later collect from that patient without ever sending a bill to the patient. These steps will more fully be detailed through the following screens within the demonstration: 

1. Open patient encounter (through various mechanisms – card swipe, prompt from practice’s existing practice management system, pick from prescheduled encounter list, or manual look up).
2. Confirm benefit plan and other information about the patient (automatically fed from the practice’s existing practice management system or real time electronic eligibility transaction).
3. Enter services performed (automatically received from practice’s existing practice management system).
4. Swipe card for patient authorization.
5. Obtain patient signature.

After that, the physician can prepare and submit an insurance claim in its normal course, a horribly complex process outside the mPay Gateway system that all practices currently do.  When the patient’s insurer finally responds to the physician with the exact amount the patient owes to the physician, the physician simply clicks the “collect” button on mPay Gateway’s payment screen to obtain payment from the patient.  

All of this is done without a single paper statement being mailed by the physician, eliminating both the complexity and waste of the paper trail that usually follows a patient after a visit to the physician.

The first is our Personal Health Platform.  Cerner is creating a person-centric, personally-owned health management platform that aggregates health information and health management programs, engaging the person to improve their health status.  By October, we will be able to demonstrate the system receiving medical records from our provider base, light condition management programs, plus traditional capabilities of a PHR - self-entry of data, etc.  We will have this technology live at partner sites by October.  Matthew mentioned that this may be a session that could align with a data utility layer session Health 2.0 has in the works.


The second is an application called HealtheAthlete that we have built to engage children to stay active for more than 60 minutes a day.  This application works in conjunction with activity monitors that children wear to track their steps and intensity of their activity.  Kids can upload their steps, keep track of their activity, compare their steps to their friends and pro athletes, and challenge others in competitions.  We are piloting this application to several child groups this summer, including competitive soccer players, fans of professional sports and children participating at an obesity program from a hospital.  Matthew mentioned that this may be a fit for the Wellness 2.0 session.

We welcome the chance to provide Health 2.0 a demonstration of the solutions above and answer any questions you might have.  Thank you!

- Free For Providers until it starts working for them (a dollar a day thereafter)

The first version of Instera’s Case Management 2.0 solution empowers case managers to orchestrate care transitions and partner with patients and their care team to avoid errors, unnecessary costs, and improve health outcomes. 

Case management is attracting increased interest to health plans, medical groups, and self-insured employers because it impacts so many healthcare dollars and patient lives and there is much room for improvement. Instera intends to set a new standard of case management that excels in engaging with patients and family; offer new means to ensure treatment plans and related tasks are executed; provide timely and actionable information to prioritize and guide decisions; and consistently ensure effective coordination of care between providers (and patient). ","","","Health 2.0 technology company providing technology or services to consumers or businesses","","Rob Karlovich, CEO
Rob is a global business leader, engineer and developer of strategic new solutions resulting in more than $250 million in revenue. He is a natural innovator and entrepreneur, accomplished at cultivating key relationships that drive strategic business development and accelerate revenue growth. Rob’s career is highlighted by recognized accomplishments in hardware, software, and communications industries for both large and small corporations. Before co-founding Instera, Rob was responsible for global business development for Ubiquity Software, a telecommunications technology start-up acquired by Avaya for $150 million.
","The Instera Easy Care Coordinator is offered by the sponsor (healthplan, medical group, other) to those patients needing case management support. Patients receive a professionally monitored and managed solution to facilitate successful implementation of all aspects of their treatment plan. Follow-through with the patient and care team is measured via an index for “Integration of Care Excellence (ICE)” a key indicator that they are executing their treatment plan and assigned tasks. Instera’s solution is built on an unplatform philosophy by a) integrating its two-way support and learning through web, iPhone, iPad, Android and other devices b) personalizing this for each patient with a focus on providing actionable information for all participants in the patient’s care. ","Instera is seed funded by Adaept Management, a Singapore-based investment firm focused on opportunities to transform healthcare. We are in the prototype stage and currently building out our first releases of the product.","We are working with key advisors with extensive experience and expertise in healthcare case management and Health 2.0 solutions. We are integrating best-of-breed modules from highly regarded partners (data, IT processes) to maximize the robustness and efficiency of core case management processes. In addition, we intend to partner with organizations representing large patient communities, as well as health plans and providers to offer entirely new value propositions that redefine the meaning of case management and the situations in which case management tools are used.","Primarily small, fragmented supplier base of software applications; internally developed solutions.

Instera intends to do to case management what the iPhone did to the mobile industry: change the rules of the game, redefining value, (patient-) engagement, and convenience. 

The companies that could be considered competitors in the case management market today are traditional software development firms, existing healthcare IT systems, training institutes, and service providers. These competitors are either small and fragmented, or large and not known for rapid, user-driven innovation. And some of them could become component-suppliers to the new Instera product solution.

Our software turns the information into clinical documentation and reports automatically.  By delivering EMR with a light footprint, WoundRounds turns the prohibitive proposition of EMR in nursing homes into an affordable, scalable model for the industry.","Telemedicine Solutions completed its third equity round in December 2009. At that time the Company had raised $3.2 million from private individuals.  Founders currently control 40% of the Company.  The balance is owned by private investors.  To-date, the Company has not received institutional funding.  However, many of its current investors are professional fund managers who have chosen to invest privately at this early stage.  Telemedicine Solutions announced its fourth round in March 2010, and is currently seeking to raise $1.5 million.","Telemedicine Solutions’ sole development partner is Breakthrough Technologies.  Both companies participate in Microsoft’s BizSpark program.

Telemedicine Solutions has a joint distribution agreement with Allscripts, an innovative leader in electronic health records and health information services. Through this agreement WoundRounds gains access to Allscripts’ leading clients, including four of the nation’s largest chains: Kindred, SavaCare, Fundamentals and Signature.
","In the nursing home market, established competitors like MDI Achieve and American HealthTech are built on dated technology, and generally lack the enhanced functionality of WoundRounds. More advanced EMR systems, like Sigma Care and Point-Click Care, are slowly emerging in the nursing home market.  However, they are expensive and require large-scale implementations. WoundRounds is easy to learn (2-3 hours classroom training), easy to use, and offers high value.  It provides both patient-level and facility-wide data at a more detailed and actionable level than other, more general computerized record systems.
Additonally, WoundRounds provides advanced analytics around wounds and risk that other generalized document-centric solutions lack.","2010-08-13 10:42:24","public","","","173.165.43.78","1","1"
