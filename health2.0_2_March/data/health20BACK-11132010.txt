Living in New Mexico and especially working with our only Level I trauma center, most patients do not have insurance but the doctors I work with have made it their mission to give the best care possible.  Three years ago we started our company when our founding physician was frustrated with how long it took him to fix a facial fracture (90 minutes) and the significant complications rates that plagued most patients all over the world (30%).  He wanted easier more efficient and innovative products but the major players in the industry had stifled innovation and have been selling products that were patented in the 1930s.  Soon our company was born over the $50,000 we put into it.  Our mission is to work with physicians to quickly push out innovative products very quickly.  We have gone from conception of product to FDA approval in 6 months.  Most companies take years.  We are able to do this by using sophisticated engineering software that mimics bone movements and can quickly do analysis on our products.  Without new innovative software our company would not exist.    I have 2 needs that I would like to fulfill at Health 2.0.  I would like to look into the latest and greatest technology that allows physicians to collect outcomes on patients and the possibility of any new design software that allows physicians to be innovative.

Health 2.0 is about individuals creating and sharing more of themselves online in a way that improves their own health, the health of others they are connected to, and the health of the community as a whole. Information therapy is based on the idea that what we think and believe -- the content of our minds -- can influence our health, either directly or through our behavior, and that we can change and influence the content of our minds and therefore also our health through information media. Personalized health, however, is infinitely diverse, and if we had to design the right information therapy for the right person at the right time, we would never finish the job. So how does Health 2.0 make information therapy possible? The needs in health care are so diverse, so complex, so personalized, and so rapidly changing, that information therapy derived from a scripted template cannot fully address the diversity of needs. Without Health 2.0, the greater the number and diversity of people with health needs, the more infinitely complex the situation becomes. Health 2.0, on the other hand, changes the information therapy equation. Because the participants also are co-creators, selectors, navigators, recommenders, and reviewers of content, the more people involved the greater their diversity, the more possible it is to meet everyone’s needs. While some traditionalists might argue about evidence-based information, the reality is that rich and diverse Health 2.0 communities are also enabling an acceleration of evidence gathering and controlled research to generate new knowledge about how information therapy works and what works for whom, so that we may truly learn how the right information can be given to the right person at the right time to improve health.\r\n\r\n','',0,'2010-06-17 15:37:33','2010-06-22 02:43:03'),(120,'3G Doctor','3gdoctor.com',NULL,NULL,NULL,'3G Doctor is a service that provides remote 3G Video Mobile access to the advice of independent General Medical Council Registered Doctors in the UK and Ireland.

Product development starts with a best practice developed by a professional society or teaching institution or simple data capture checklist. The protocol or checklist is integrated into a computerized template that is stored with correlating clinical knowledge and reference material. mTuitive suite of software solutions consume and deliver these templates to everyday users on their workstations, touchscreen kiosks or via the web. Our team of human factors professionals have developed efficient and powerful user interfaces that correlate to the appropriate use case. The user follows the template in the software and inputs data electronically. Results data may be collected in an mTuitive repository for patient records and future analysis. The end result greatly simplifies the process of entering patient information or clinical findings and keeps the users up-to-date and educated.

I have since been part of a founding or management team for a number of software startup companies - some proved to be financially successful, a few did not.   mTuitive is my first venture into the healthcare space and so far it has been very rewarding.  While my job description pertains mostly to establishing and managing partnership distribution models, I believe it is my product management experience that has played the most influential role to this team.

(Since I\\\'ve lived in NC for about 20 years, I now use the southern version of Hi out of habit!)  I have an interesting blend of Marketing, Sales and Technology background after 23 years in industry-the majority of that with GSK.

No, we are not technology experts-we are business experts who understand what technology can bring to a commercial organization.

I take care of patients in the outpatient setting and in my daily work, I witness many challenges but even more opportunities in health care delivery innovation.

Rather than merely collect more \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"patient data\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" through sophisticated gadgets, or move more physicians toward increasingly \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"hands-on\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" patient relationships, I still believe in patient-driven solutions that are simple, cheap, and available to all.    My company is an attempt to engage patients in new ways-- even though to ask them to adjust their own medications is not novel (we\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve been doing it with insulin for decades)-- and to partner in ways that lead to meaningful change.  My focus on underserved populations is based on the principle that those with the fewest resources tend to gain the most from system improvements.  Clinical care is no different.

First, on-demand viewers in general actively seek out programming. Second, on-demand health viewers are viewing specific videos for a particular reason (i.e. watching a video on melanoma because their mother was diagnosed with it). These viewers are not passively watching programming - instead they are actively seeking out programs. The growth of consumer-selected video both online and on television creates a new information platform to educate and inform current and potential patients. Long format disease topic videos presented as “opt in” experiences allow for more in-depth, “3rd party” content than traditional broadcast-oriented video advertisements. After health professionals, someone with the same condition is most important to consumers seeking advice about particular medications and the care process. The “stars” of online and cable VOD health videos may be the newest set of KOLs to emerge on the healthcare scene. A recent survey of online viewers found that 34% of Americans turn to social media for health research. And, half of VOD and broadband video viewers talk to their doctors after viewing a specific title, creating an engaged and action oriented audience. The emergence of the so-called “Consumer Opinion Leader” is an extremely important online heath resource for 2/3 of individuals who go online for health information and a call to action to all social media companies who play in the health literacy space.

Now Payers and Providers will have to deal with both HIPAA and financial regulations such as PCI, FFIEC, and card association rules to support a consumer healthcare mobile wallet. Proposed Presentation Summary Recent initiatives by Google and Microsoft to enter the PHR (personal health record) market has highlighted the role of the consumer in managing their own healthcare. At the same time providers are pushing more costs down to the payers who are subsequently pushing higher costs down to the large employer groups who are in turn encouraging their employees into higher co-pays and deductibles. On top of this, the USA government has allowed personal HSA (health savings accounts) to help fund these escalating costs and they expect that the consumer will have to get more proactive in managing their families healthcare services and payments. There is convergence happening between the financial services industry and the healthcare industry where Payers will have to deal with both HIPPA and financial regulations such as PCI, FFIEC, and card association rules. A secure authenticated mobile health wallet as a platform to address all of the above issues is required as a relief valve and tool for the mobile consumer to manage their healthcare services and payments.

I would like participate as a commentator in order to share my knowledge and experience for the need for Health 2.0, healthcare reform and how many innovative new projects, not just DocMatcher, are making that happen. I would also be able to share my opinion on the need and possible direction for further innovation. I have extensive knowledge of the patient, doctor, legal and legislative perspective of health 2.0, the limitations of each and my own ideas about what can be done to ease the process. I have been sitting in on many discussions regarding the direction for Health 2.0 and I am not sure I agree with the language and direction with the current legislation. I want people to have more of a hand in creating that legislation and the participants at your conference and their members are just the people that will be able to do that.\n\nFounded',1,'2010-06-17 16:07:10','2010-06-25 07:08:02'),(515,'Integrative Logic','www.integrativelogic.com',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Data drive marketing agency','',0,'2010-06-17 16:07:12','2010-06-29 07:02:51'),(516,'YourNurseIsOn.com','www.yournurseison.com',NULL,NULL,NULL,'YourNurseIsOn.com (YNIO) is an internet based, healthcare communications system that uses Internet and SMS messaging to give hospitals unprecedented access to healthcare staff.\n','',1,'2010-06-17 16:07:13','2010-06-26 03:25:33'),(517,'Medsphere Systems','www.medsphere.com',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Medsphere is a provider of open-source healthcare enterprise solutions that enable operational and financial improvement through clinical transformation.\n\nMedsphere......s product OpenVista®, is a commercially implemented open-source application for management of the clinical care cycle.

Furthermore, 85 percent of hospitals, ambulatory clinics and physician office practices have yet to automate their care processes. Why? The answer lies not in technology offerings, but in the proprietary, closed software business model that fails to service adequately the mainstream health care marketplace. The Open Source business and development model, on the other hand, offers health care an opportunity to transform itself and deployments now live across the country support this hypothesis. This session will explore how the acceptance of the open source business model across other industries -- from Linux, Redhat, MySQL and Jboss just to name a few -- have resulted in more affordable, more stable, more secure and more customizable software systems now being leveraged for healthcare.

','Note: At Jane Sarasohn-Kahn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\......s suggestion, I emailed this proposal to Matthew and Indu but wanted to also submit it through the website for the sake of completeness. PANEL: “Cats vs. Dogs” PERSPECTIVE from an Information Intermediary: I agree completely with Matthew Holt’s sentiment that health IT does not reform a healthcare system, it only supports what it is plugged into. However, I also believe passionately that information is a key lever in health reform, and a critical component of a reformed system. Information is needed to measure outcomes, to create incentives, to overhaul any part of healthcare, and to keep stakeholders honest over time. Information that is trustworthy, understandable, and consistent will empower us as consumers to make sense of our complex healthcare environment while managing our own health. Before there can be “data liquidity” that empowers the consumer, there has to be digital data. First we have to get it off paper and out of human-readable form and turn it into digital, in machine-readable form. Then we need to share it among all of the computers across healthcare so that there is something called a patient-centric longitudinal electronic health record. And then, we need to give a copy of that record to the consumer, only translated into something that a normal person can understand. But we’re getting ready to solve that problem in a meaningful way, $17.2 billion times over, right? The health IT stimulus will put an EHR in every doctor’s office and – presto! – we’re there, right? Wrong. As we herd the cats and dogs of health IT for this panel, the unique perspective of the information intermediary should be included in the conversation. For over 25 years, information intermediaries have allowed those who want structure and proven technology (cats) to communicate effectively, even to unify, with those who want the freedom of proprietary systems and the newest tools (dogs). Information intermediaries offer a place where cats and dogs come to make beautiful music together. (Yes, that was an intentional sentence that mashes together two different analogies from Matthew Holt’s January 22, 2009 blog.) The fact is that the healthcare marketplace will never be at a level of complete IT parity, any more than the United Nations will chose one world-wide language. Rather, the healthcare market will continue to require an independent and universal translation service, and this need will increase as more paper-based data becomes digital via stimulus funding. Some may consider the information intermediary an outmoded concept, blaming “clearinghouses” as money-grubbing vendors whose intention is solely to ensure that healthcare stakeholders remain isolated and stuck in their own languages. In truth, the national health information network (NHIN) vision requires such intermediaries, it just calls them something different. Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) are a re-do of the Community Health Information Networks (CHINs) of the 1990s, which were themselves an attempt to create a data exchange mechanism between multiple healthcare trading partners. Today, Dr. Halamka and others will testify that most, if not all, of the financially sustainable HIEs are based, at least in part, on the tried-and-true administrative clearinghouse model of the 1980s. And the consumer? Unfortunately, the consumer participation in this harmonious symphony of data liquidity is still a little further down the road. The clinical information exchange needed to create a patient-centric longitudinal EHR, and then ultimately a PHR, will be the end-state but there are many meaningful steps between here and there. Fortunately, the industry has learned something about ubiquitous, interoperable information exchange from the administrative side of the market, and those lessons can be applied to clinical HIE, and ultimately will serve the consumer well. What the Audience Will Learn: •History of health information exchange models – from the clearinghouses of the 1980s, to the CHINs of the 1990s, to today’s HIEs and the NHIN •The role of standards across the ages – from the “National Standard Format” of the 1980s, to HIPAA in the 1990s, to the abyss of clinical standards needed for clinical HIE today •Why consumers are STILL left out of the health IT stimulus, as meaningful use is focused solely on providers proving what they do to consumers and if they should get paid for it •What the geeky weirdness of ANSI X12, HL7, NCPDP, NUBC, NUCC, HITSP, LOINC, SNOWMED, and more is absolutely necessary',0,'2010-06-17 16:08:26','2010-06-30 16:21:39'),(553,'Telehealth Mashup (IBM)','www.ibm.com',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Telehealth Mashup is a pilot program developed by IBM that shows how composite applications can be used by healthcare professionals to provide more effective care by being able to tailor their “view” of a patient.

The rise of social networking is redefining the notion of on-line presence and fundamentally changing how people collaborate and interact with each other. In this demonstration we will show how connected health solutions will become more effective by integrating physical device readings with a patient’s own support system, as realized through social networking technology.

','The sustainability of healthcare benefits hinges on effective means for nudging better behavior on the part of both patient and physicians. Growing evidence makes it abundantly clear that financial incentives alone won’t motivate these changes.

Now more than ever, plan sponsors cannot afford economic waste –- spending more, but not getting more.

When applied correctly, choice architecture makes the obvious thing to do right.

Early applications of choice architecture in healthcare are surprisingly effective.

Non-profit promoting open source tools in health care','I think there are several main efforts that we are going to work on that have specific relevance for the Health 2.0 crowd. First we are probably be going to work to release one or more drug databases under FOSS licenses, as well as maintenance releases on those databases. This is going to allow for people to circumvent the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\......FirstData tax\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' when building Health 2.0 applications. We are planning on allowing access to this both as a download and as a web service, both at minimal cost-to-operate fees and with FOSS redistribution rights. We will be working to release more data sources in a similar fashion, but drugs make the biggest splash. Second we will be releasing a series of FOSS code that will serve as starting points for mashups of these new FOSS data sources, and traditional web-services. These snippets will be both for demonstration purposes and to enable bolt on feature additions to current Health 2.0 applications. We will be promoting libraries that is intended to provide a unified meta-interface to HealthVault and GoogleHealth, so that you can code to both at once. We will also be offering a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Doctor Verification\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' Federated Authentication system using SAML and OpenID. Essentially this web-service will allow you to trust that a user has proven that they are a clinician. This will allow sites to create physician only sections to web sites and web applications. For instance, you could create a wiki with a wiki page for every doctor in the United states and then ensure that it each page was only accessible to the doctor in question. Or you could enable doctor responses to a doctor review site, knowing that the right doctor was responding. Essentially we will encouraging the development of new Health 2.0 applications by providing both unique FOSS code and web-services providing FOSS data that will lower the price point and difficult of producing a Health 2.0 application. Using our services and code a single developer could probably replicate what it would have taken an entire company to produce just last year.... If Google is the prototype Web 2.0 company then its enabling technology platform is Linux project, GNU/Linux runs all of its public facing servers. Similarly the FOSS healthcare movement can provide a code platform for Health 2.0 companies, drastically reducing the code that needs to be written in-house. Generally my presentation would be about all the examples of how to do this using modern FOSS projects like Mirth, OHT and CONNECT.

A possible cost control and quality improvement driver for healthcare would be to empower the patient to partner with physicians to focus on prevention prior to needing expensive cure. While technology has made great strides in the clinical and medical device aspects of healthcare and emerging in EMR, however the application of the latest advances in social media or smartphone technologies are yet to make deep inroads in improving the quality of care or patient experience as many other industries have undergone transformation leveraging automation and collaboration to reduce cost and improve quality.\n\nMore people now use the Internet as a source of health information than their personal physicians (59 % versus 55% in a recent study). However, quantity and varying quality of information on the Internet raises its own problems. Patients may have to spend considerable amount of time on Internet only to get totally overwhelmed by sheer volume of information requiring synthesis. In frustration, they may revert to what they had always done, forget the Internet and see their physician which only increases the total cost of healthcare. On the other hand unless patients are knowledgeable to proactively manage their health, many preventable diseases are not treated on time leading to mortality and higher cost of cure. Support networks of patients with same or similar conditions are valuable sources of information. However, 77 % of elderly have multiple chronic diseases. Imagine having a fairly common combination of conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high lipids and low thyroid and trying to put together a plan using the Internet. Also, our goal should be to prevent such illnesses in the first place. However, creating a health maintenance plan through Internet will be even more daunting because of large number of preventable illnesses. Our solution leverages computerized social networks or SmartPhones to enable patients to be active partners and collaborators with their caregivers, medical professionals and other stakeholders in health including insurance companies, government and the society.\n\n',0,'2010-06-17 16:10:56','2010-06-29 13:20:19'),(670,'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention','http://www.cdc.gov',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Title: Pandemic 2.0\r\n\r\nThis presentation will explore how the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has leveraged 2.0 technologies, strategies, and applications to help keep the public informed about the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.

In three simple steps, this product enables a health care provider to calculate what the patient will owe, obtain the patient’s authorization, and later collect from that patient without ever sending a bill. The calculate, validate and collect steps will more fully be detailed through the following screens within the demonstration: 1. Open patient encounter (through various mechanisms – card swipe, prompt from practice’s existing practice management system, pick from pre-scheduled encounter list, or manual look up) 2. Confirm benefit plan and other information about the patient (automatically fed from the practice’s existing practice management system) 3. Enter services performed (automatically received from practice’s existing practice management system) 4. Swipe card for patient authorization 5. Obtain patient signature 6. Prepare and submit insurance claim in normal course, a horribly complex process outside the mPay Gateway systems that all practices currently do 7. After receiving the remittance advice from insurer detailing the exact amount patient owes, hit the “collect” button on mPay Gateway’s payment screen to settle funds. mPay Gateway is the only service that is focused directly on the patient payment obligation. Others in the health care IT space combine patient payment tools with other health care technology, such as eligibility look up, claim creation and submission or EDI services. mPay Gateway’s simple process allows health care providers to reduce their bad debt by 50% or more with a minimum of process change in their practice. The mPay Gateway product’s impact stems from the relative ease of adoption compared to the dramatic change in the financial performance of the practice. The “Wow!” factor comes from the eye-popping results our customers report – 50% drop in receivables, 75% drop in statementing costs, 100% gains in collections. The difference between using mPay Gateway and continuing to push along the old way of collecting the increasing patient payment obligation is the difference between thriving as a practice and not surviving at all.

You would think this is random fact, but for me, this is a very important food allergy.  In fact, green apples were wreaking havoc on my life.  Not many people know this small factoid, but green apples are a known trigger food for migraines.  I have suffered with migraines my whole life, receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of treatment over 20 years.  My wife, tired of seeing me suffer through migraines that lasted for days on end, decided to start tracking my health...all of it.  She tracked my food, my exercise, sleep patterns, medications, bowel movements, moods, water intake...you name it, she tracked it.  And then we started changing things, eliminating and re-introducing foods, changing medications, drinking more water, and any other factor that could be related.  Eventually we found my favorite afternoon snack since I was 8 years old, a fresh green Granny Smith apple, led to a migraine every single time.  I gave up green apples for Fuji......s, and reduced my migraines by 80%.  The last 20% comes from packaged foods.   Green apple juice is used as a sweetener in a lot of packaged and prepared foods, so we started reading labels of food.  Today, I have 2 or 3 migraines a year and a start-up, HealtheHuman.\n\nAfter this experience, we started HealtheHuman in 2006.  Professionally, I am a hands-on technologist, with nearly two decades experience building organizations and leading teams to produce cutting-edge, innovate software solutions to challenging problems.

Such settings set new challenges to Health 2.0 as they create electronic communities of educated users in technologically poor or even virgin environments. Health status, together with education, represent the two major challenges for those parts of the developing world that have found (even partial) solutions on drinkable water and nutrition.

Today’s Health 2.0 systems assume a technology advanced environment. Mitigating it to the OLPC reality should take into account power consumption, network bandwidth and processing limitations.

A primary and increasingly relevant example of this type of social networking (which we also refer to as .....peer mentoring\\\\\\\") is provided by Internet-based social networking sites for patients. As a social/health psychologist, one of my primary interests is in understanding the effects of social networking or peer mentoring on people who are coping with a medical problem. My main interest is cancer, but the processes I study are relevant for other medical diagnoses as well. There is reason to believe that health-related social networking/peer mentoring conveys information that could affect health decision making in addition to psychological adjustment of patients (e.g. anxiety or hope). My research group has documented the potential for patients who connect with survivors with their diagnosis to be distressed by the experience, rather than helped by it. Of course, it is also the case that many people are helped by this kind of social networking. An important issue is that there is currently no way to predict whether a particular social contact will be negative or positive. Moreover, there is little guidance that can be given to social interaction partners to help them make it a good experience for both of them. One of the goals of my research is to draw attention to the potential for social networking of this type to have unintended consequences and the need to conduct research to understand issues surrounding enabling this kind of social networking in the health arena. I believe this will become an increasingly important topic as use of the Internet to share personal health experiences becomes more and more popular.  \n \n\n REVENUES: \n \n FINANCING HISTORY: \n\n FINANCING SOUGHT: \n\n REVENUES: \n\n PEOPLE BIO:\nI have a Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of California at Los Angeles, where I also completed predoctoral training in health psychology (funded by the National Institute of Mental Health).

RemoteRep® combines all interactions with customers into a single profile point designed to makes sales representatives more effective.','As you are aware, the market is changing – rapidly. Appetites for the traditional rep/physician model have waned and the entire system of communication appears broken due to a lack of evolution. Pharma companies are having to reduce costs and they are looking at the marketing and sales budgets as a fast-cash approach. This works from an accounting and share price perspective, but it is short term thinking that will end up hurting them in the long run if alternatives are not employed. Despite this gloomy outlook, I tend to look at this as an opportunity for the industry to take a positive step forward, hear what their customers are saying, and embrace the chance provided to them to communicate in a whole new way. Enter RemoteRep®. RemoteRep® is a solution for the ailments facing the pharma industry. Rationally designed to serve the needs of Sales and Marketing it simplifies the process of increasing access, reach, and frequency of messaging. Sales reps or telesales (company or outsourced) can work from the same e-detail content and design to reach customers face-to-face, online, or remotely. Gone are the days of no-see doctors and months between interactions. Brands need to be ready to speak when their customers are ready to listen. Gone are the days of trying to convince physicians to remember a website / login / password by sending them a direct mail or invitation letter. Direct links bring them into the content. Gone are the days of WebEx and GoToMeeting clunky sharing of desktop material where initiating a meeting requires software downloads and difficult scheduling by the end user. Instant easy access and complete rep control of the content shared occurs in real-time and even included full motion video. Now, using RemoteRep®, the Sales team – in-house, on the street, or outsourced inbound and outbound – can be available to detail the customer using approved materials. But that is just the beginning. Using the 3 modes of communication in the RemoteRep® system – RepServ (face to face), RemoteServ (conference of 1:1 or 1:many), and SelfServ (online invitation style) – all activities are tracked, comparable, and linked to a customer profile automatically, instantly, and in the same location. From an analytics perspective this is ideal as it provides a complete picture of the sales interaction. Now reps can see what they have presented to the customer in person or remotely, and they can see what their customer wanted to see on their own. If what they want to see is not being reinforced by the rep when they are calling then there is a disconnect that needs to be fixed. Better still, the reports are viewable online by any approved person. This means that Marketing can now see in real time if their materials are being used, if POAs are being followed, what messages are resonating and which are being challenged, how long reps are actually spending on the brands, etc. all at the click of a button. Gone are the days of having Sales Ops run a report from the “system”. Imagine the freedom. No restrictions for design. No barriers regarding the information that can be shared. Leverage interactive tools that have already been created. Incorporate video, animation, PDFs, clinical reprints, creative and copy into a cohesive communication vehicle. Grids, tabs, and frames no longer restrict the creative mind. There are no limits. Imagine the possibilities. And there is more. Fixed costs for licenses allow reps to use the system as much as they want without the burden of the per use or per click calculation. Gone are the days of brands being punished for successfully communicating with their customers. RemoteRep® is a service system for the industry. We provide the software and the services to support its ongoing functionality. IT groups need only be marginally involved. Everything is included in the annual licensing fee. What could be simpler? Ultimately, RemoteRep® allows companies to provide improved services at a reduced cost. If they outsource the lead generation to our TeleSales or another service, the savings are instantly measurable and significant, often greater than 60%. There are numerous other benefits that RemoteRep® offers and some that we have likely not even considered at this point. The whole idea of CLM or CLP unfortunately has left a gaping hole since tablet based platforms rely on the traditional model of the rep-in-office to be successful. Since we can see the writing on the proverbial wall that the this model is going the way of the Dodo , RemoteRep® offers companies the new way to reach their healthcare customers and the customers can obtain the information they need to make better decisions. This is just the start.

The underdeveloped item at Health 2.0 may be the dramatic transformative clinical relevance of connecting Health 2.0 user-generated content to the wider health care system. The traditional medical model relied on prevalent health to equate to ?normal? health of crowds. This paradigm is completely outdated as the US majority became 66% overweight or obese (read highly prevalent no longer has anything to do with desired or optimal health).  The Health 2.0 user generated content effort is precisely the key to pulling us out from under the ineffective paradigm of ? normal? and delivering real-time adaptive access to optimal. User-generated content (more than expert-generated content) will be the key to transforming the health of crowds sustainably. We demonstrate (using examples)  how current employee wellness efforts (instructional models) are underperforming and how the Health 2.0 (participatory model) will generate a quantum leap in ROI for large self-insured employers.

With 32 Million Americans who did not previously have health insurance now gaining access, the medical profession is sure to see an uptick in demand.    Today, the web is the most powerful branding tool available. The web provides more access to branding opportunities than ever before with extremely low barriers of entry.  The share of adult internet users who have a profile on an online social network site has more than quadrupled in the past four years ? from 8% in 2005 to over 40% today.  Facebook for example currently has in excess of 350 million active users on a global basis with 50% of active users logging into the site every day.  This presents a unique opportunity for direct communication or ?digital direct marketing?.  ADAM BIERMAN President of The Brand X Group   Adam Bierman has spent his life as an innovator.  One to question the traditional approach, Adam?s reputation for being a trailblazing serial entrepreneur has led to business success and an amazing outlook on life.  Similar to former NBA star Michael Jordan, the quote ?I can accept failure, but I can?t accept not trying? is the approach he incorporates into his personal and business life.    In 2002, while attending the University of Southern California Adam co-founded All In Enterprises, a company that monetized poker brands, personalities, video games, cell phone applications, events and online gaming sites.  Adam was a force behind branding the poker-market, as we know it today.    Adam continued his string of successful ventures with his launch of Total Package Sports Management, a national sports agency representing over forty professional baseball players including the likes of Evan Longoria, Casey Fien, Jerry Blevins and Aaron Cunningham among many others.  Word got out about his furious poker face and rapid growing success as a branding expert and Adam?s idea of combining fresh marketing and branding approaches to athletes led to TPSM being absorbed by the marketing firm XTS Global.   With his roots in marketing, sports and gaming, in 2009 Adam founded The Brand X Group where he currently resides as President.  The Brand X Group is a brand management firm whose focus lies on a comprehensive approach to the marketing side of business growth.  Taking advantage of the opportunities presented by today?s various media platforms and technology, the Brand X Group works with clients to deliver a message to their intended audience in the most swift, efficient and cost effective manner.  Parallel to his body of professional work, The Brand X Group continues his legacy of demonstrating that branding is a universal and essential element of business.    Adam has been a guest speaker at numerous marketing and branding events, in addition to frequent appearances within television, Internet and radio media discussing various marketing subjects.  Thought leader, pacesetter, motivator and entrepreneur, Adam Bierman?s reputation for inventive techniques and precise implementation is as recognized as his thirst for success.

While personal health is an altruistic societal goal, other than smoking cessation, there is little other behavior change (of a personal, commercial or community nature) that has risen to the level of becoming part of our culture.  And when a movement becomes enculturated, powerful forces are unleashed that can do more than any policy or program - whether private or governmental - ever could.  Therein lay the vision for the Culture of Health Organization.\n\nThe most significant missing element to transform health from an ideal to a movement is leadership; leadership on a family unit basis, in the workplace and on a community/governmental level.  To address this deficit, we are building a founding board of advisers who will bring leadership credentials from the world of consumer engagement, business, and community activism/government.  These individuals will contribute their expertise and guidance gleaned from the fields of consumer marketing, social anthropology/culture development and public policy development let alone health and health care.\n\nAs the organization grows, we will be open to all contributors and collaborators with the intent of pulling in otherwise competing commercial entities (e.g., health plans, consultants/brokers, pharma) and related non-profits (e.g., APHA, NBGH, PBGH, IBI) in a way that makes it worth their while to participate with COHO rather than going it alone.\n\nThe seminal event for COHO will be its inaugural conference slated for Q4\'08 or Q1\'09.  From that point forward, COHO will be a self-sustaining non-profit with revenues derived from:\n-- annual membership (organizational entity memberships and organizations sponsoring individuals; i.e., an employer sponsoring each of their employees for $1 per year)\n-- benchmarking / data\n-- Culture of Health certification and ongoing royalties\n-- Royalties from \"Healthy Reality\" - a technology/service incubator combined with a TV reality module embedded in an existing TV show (e.g., Oprah, Rachel Ray, Today, Discovery Channel, The Food Network).\n\nClearly Health 2.0 is focused on the supply side of this critically important transformation in health and health care.  With the exception of Health Reality (see above), COHO will be more about the demand side of the equation.

The first is Dutch and called zorghelden.net (translates to heroes of care) and is a healthcare cooperative society. With a Dutch university hospital I aim to develop a full online coach program to help people that suffer from heart disease and diabetes to set and achieve health goals through integrated care coordinated by the coach. The patient side of the website will be \'social\' where users can form groups, invite people to their group, stimulate each other with health challenges, exchange experiences they had with coaches, earn points for goals achieved as a group that can be spend online and offline.  On the careprovider side of the website, the online coach program offers the possibility to people with sufficient medical education to participate and enroll as a member of the coorporation, follow training, adopt a standard of care and offer their services to users of the website. Services are paid for by a Dutch healthcare insurer based upon success rate and user satisfaction with the coach. With this initiative I hope to help reduce the demand for care by making the participation in own healthcare fun. Also I hope to help to improve the delivery of integrated care to the user while reducing the (ginourmous upcoming) shortage of careproviders by enabling those who are not active in the medical field today to enroll as a coach.\n\nThe second is called healthiez.com (pronounce health ease) which is a platform (full open API) to log personal health outcomes (medication intake, blood pressure, blood glucose, pain, sleep, mood etc) by synchronizing medical applications from a smartphone as well as outcomes from health devices, (bio) sensors and smart medication sensors (all data send via the smartphone). I aim to develop a service to interpret those outcomes through algorithms and correltations into simple graphs and health ratings (from which no medical conclusions should be drawn unless originating from objective monitoring via e.g. sensors, devices connected to the internet). The community discusses health issues related to the things users try to improve, compare scores with other users, give each other challenges to improve and exchange tips.

My coding system gives structure to detailed accurate data that comes from and belongs to the patient with lab and clinician input. It is an anonymous password protected medical record controlled by the patient. Since our soft launch in Oct 2009 we have >2000 new users from >70 countries around the world. The data structure and direct usefulness of the record permitting patients to better be seen by practitioners promotes self efficacy and fits the Fourth Paradigm model of Jim Gray as a basis for letting medical data talk and shifting the medical paradigm away from name-it, blame-it, and tame-it prescription pad medicine toward a systems-based approach centered on the individual.I was the guy at the DC conference last month who made a comment from the audience that the collaborative relationship between patient and physician that comes from sharing the record is not all about content but also about ethos. My patented technology is based on work I started when I was an Asst Prof of Medical Computer Sciences at Yale in 1969 and continued through years of practice where I developed a multidimensional coding system for medicine......s granular data: signs, symptoms, life events, exposures, lab data, etc. The patent specifies a .....system and method for the automated presentation of health data to, and its interaction with, a computer maintained database, to generate information regarding possible remedies, therapies, problem solutions and beneficial practices, to improve user health.” Filed on Sep 15, 2000, Sidney M. Baker, inventor etc. Graphic presentation of data gathered into my data structure (first published in 1991) shows its power for using IT as a \"macroscope\" for discovering otherwise invisible patterns.
