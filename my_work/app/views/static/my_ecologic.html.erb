	<br/>
	<span class="main_copy_font">Today, measures that we have taken have resulted in 35% more fuel efficiency for every mile we drive on our routes. In order to realize our goals of a zero emissions fleet, we will continue to invest in and research the most advanced technology where feasible. In the interim, we are teaming up with <a href="http://www.terrapass.com/" target="_blank">TerraPass</a> to offset the CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions that are inevitable. In addition, we will continue to apply responsible operating procedures to further reduce our impact on the environment. For example, our Green Leaf delivery system encourages customers to pool their orders to create more efficient routes and decrease the number of vehicle starts and distance traveled. <a href="#0">back to top </a></span>

	<a name="2" id="2"><span class="subtitleGreen">OUR LAUNDRY SERVICE EQUIPMENT</span> 
	<br/>
	<span class="main_copy_font">Our current laundry services equipment uses less energy and wastes less water than other industrial washer-extractor machines. We are committed to using less energy where feasible and continue to research advanced methodologies to conserve available resources. Our greatest impact on the environment is through our electricity usage, therefore, My Fresh Shirt has committed to purchasing 100% of its energy consumption through clean and renewable sources that are produced locally. In addition to energy conservation, we are committed to using environmentally and biologically safe cleaning solvents and additives, readily biodegradable solutions, and proper and safe disposal of waste products. <a href="#0">back to top </a></span>

	<a name="3" id="3"><span class="subtitleGreen">OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH TERRAPASS</span> 
	<br/>
	<span class="main_copy_font">We have teamed up with one of the most progressive companies that offers carbon offset credits in the market today. <a href="http://www.terrapass.com/" target="_blank">TerraPass</a></span><span class="main_copy_font"> funds three different project types: clean wind energy, farm power from animal waste, and landfill gas recapture. We chose to work with <a href="http://www.terrapass.com/" target="_blank">TerraPass</a> because of their commitment to true transparency and investment in projects that will result in reductions in the same calendar year guaranteeing that our investments are making a difference now. <a href="#0">back to top </a></span>

	<a name="4" id="4"><span class="subtitleGreen">CULTURAL AWARENESS</span> 
	<br/>
	<span class="main_copy_font">My Fresh Shirt recognizes that the preservation of the environment is an essential part of our business practices. We are committed to promoting a culture that is focused on being environmentally sensitive as we work with our employees, customers, suppliers, industry organizations and the communities we serve in safeguarding the environment for future generations. <a href="#0">back to top </a></span>

	<a name="5" id="5"><span class="subtitleGreen">CONSERVE TO PRESERVE</span> 
	<br/>
	<span class="main_copy_font">At My Fresh Shirt, we react progressively to the mounting problem of waste. Our company is focused on reducing the amount of waste we produce by limiting the amount of printed material we use, utilizing reusable laundry and dry cleaning bags, where the dry cleaning bag converts to a garment bag to serve two purposes, and utilizing the internet as much as possible to deliver marketing material and promotions. In addition we have a no questions asked recycling program where we collect our customers used hangers and poly plastic bags even if they come from our competitors because increasing landfills are everybodyâ€™s problem. <a href="#0">back to top </a></span>

	<a name="6" id="6"><span class="subtitleGreen">GOING BEYOND CARBON NEUTRAL</span> 
	<br/>
	<span class="main_copy_font">Because My Fresh Shirt refuses to take a neutral stance on our environment and our community, we do not see a reason to only go carbon neutral. We have taken a proactive stance to not only mitigate our impact but to invest in opportunities that will effectively reverse our impact on the environment. We have partnered with our customers in our My Fresh Air and My Fresh Water program to have a net positive result on the world we share. All this while providing the most convenient laundry and dry cleaning solution that never sacrifices professional quality and top notch customer service. <a href="#0">back to top </a></span>
