> <B>My Fresh Shirt service</B><I> </I></P
><P 
 align="justify"
><I>Ordering through My Fresh Shirt&rsquo;s site</I>. The first time you place an order, you will set up a log-in ID, fill out a set of cleaning preferences, provide contact information and select a payment method. Next, you will select a desired My Fresh Shirt service, and then be directed to the pick-up and delivery schedule, where you will select the desired day and time of service. The maximum allowable time between scheduled pick-up and delivery windows may vary depending on your service area. Your order can be placed at any time, so long as the desired pick-up or delivery time window is not at capacity. Any modifications to an existing order can be made, so long as it&rsquo;s not less than 1 day prior to your scheduled service. You will only be billed once your garments have been cleaned and delivered. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
><I>Pick Up of Items</I>. [My Fresh Shirt uses trucks marked with the My Fresh Shirt logo for easy identification.] Your items will be picked up during the requested pick up service window and will be brought back to our sorting facility later that day. Once the items are sorted, an itemized invoice will be emailed to you, detailing the different services and costs for that particular transaction. If a garment requires additional care outside of the normal cleaning process, an email will be sent to you detailing those services and associated costs, [for your approval]. After your first transaction, you will receive a set of My Fresh Shirt laundry bags which you will need to use when scheduling future pick-ups. A nominal bag deposit may be required for the re-usable laundry bags that My Fresh Shirt will provide you Should you decide to no longer use My Fresh Shirtâ€™s service, you will be credited the bag deposit when you return your My Fresh Shirt laundry and/or garment bags. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
><I>Our Cleaning Process</I>. We are committed to providing you with the most convenient, highest quality, and most environmentally friendly service. Our quality control process includes reviewing garments for additional spotting and touching up, and inspecting for missing buttons and loose seams and pant cuffs. Under some circumstances, My Fresh Shirt may replace buttons and repair certain garments free of charge, provided that you elect us to do so. For this option, please refer to the preferences section under your profile. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
><I>Delivery of Items</I>. To receive delivery, you or your doorman must be present to receive your order from our driver during your requested delivery window. Anyone at the delivery address who receives the delivery is conclusively presumed to be authorized to receive the delivery. If you or your doorman are not present during your selected delivery window, we will attempt to contact you and reschedule delivery for a more convenient time. If we are unable to redeliver the order to you for any reason, the order will be returned to our warehouse and you will need to designate a new delivery window, whereupon additional service charges may apply. My Fresh Shirt will not be responsible for any items left in our possession after thirty (30) days. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>We exercise the utmost care in processing all articles entrusted to us and use such processes which, in our opinion, are best suited to the nature and condition of each individual article. Unfortunately, we cannot assume responsibility for inherent weaknesses of or defects in materials that are not readily apparent prior to processing. This applies particularly, but not exclusively, to suedes, leathers, silks, satins, double-faced fabrics, vinyls, polyurethanes, etc. Responsibility also is disclaimed for trimmings, buckles, beads, buttons, bells and sequins. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>In laundering we cannot guarantee against color loss and shrinkage or against damage to weak and tender fabrics. Problems or concerns with regard to any damaged article must be reported to My Fresh Shirt within 48 hours of receiving the article in question. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
><I>Refunds:</I> My Fresh Shirt&rsquo;s refund and/or liability for a lost or damaged article[s] shall be limited to, at My Fresh Shirt&rsquo;s election, repairing or replacing any lost/damaged article[s] at a cost not to exceed 10 times the charge for processing such article and/or providing you with a refund for the cost of services. If the order in question was a Premium order, My Fresh Shirt&rsquo;s liability with respect to any lost or damaged article[s] shall not exceed 30 times our charge for processing such article [unless stated otherwise]. My Fresh Shirt&rsquo;s liability for lost or damaged Wash and Fold orders [both Standard and Premium processing types] shall be limited to, at My Fresh Shirt&rsquo;s election, replacing lost/damaged article[s] at a cost not to exceed 10 times the charge for processing said order.  In the case of a damaged article[s] My Fresh Shirt may require the return of the item in question for inspection in order to determine the cause of damage prior to performing additional services, issuing a reimbursement, or issuing a credit.  </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>In an effort to meet the committed delivery times for our customers, our delivery personnel may not be able to wait for an inspection of the items delivered. Upon delivery of your order, you will receive an email containing an itemization of the items you received and were billed for. If something is missing from your order, please contact one of our customer service representatives by sending us an email at <A href="mailto:customercare@myfreshshirt.com">
<U>customerservice@myfreshshirt.com</U></A>
 . Any discrepancies concerning your order must be reported within 48 hours upon receipt of your order. Unless you itemized the order in question and My Fresh Shirt reconciled and agreed to said itemization, our count must be accepted. My Fresh Shirt&rsquo;s liability with respect to any lost article shall not exceed 10 times our charge for processing it. If the order in question was a Premium order, My Fresh Shirt&rsquo;s liability with respect to any lost article shall not exceed 30 times our charge for processing it [unless stated otherwise]. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>If you contest any of the aforementioned, your sole and exclusive remedy hereunder shall be for you to discontinue your use of the My Fresh Shirt service and to terminate this agreement. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential, incidental, or special damages or of implied warranties, in such states and jurisdictions liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>In the case of inclement weather, or unforeseen delivery complications, it may be necessary to make adjustments to our delivery schedule. Such adjustments may lead us to suspend chosen delivery dates and times. If there are significant delays, a customer service representative will make a best effort to notify you of the status of your delivery time. We will deliver your order as soon as the conditions permit. If your designated delivery location (i.e., street, avenue, etc.) is inaccessible, rendering us unable to make the delivery, we will contact you to determine the best alternate location. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>In the interest of safety, we do not deliver to walk-ups (a building without an elevator) above the 5th floor. In the event of a broken elevator, we also do not ask our drivers to carry deliveries more than 5 floors. Our technology cannot, and does not, enforce these limits. We ask our customers to abide by these service limitations, as we may limit deliveries when orders exceed these requirements. Again, this limitation exists only to protect the health of our delivery staff. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
>Customers are under no obligation to tip our delivery team. My Fresh Shirt team members are not allowed to solicit or accept tips. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
><I>Credit Card Payment.</I> Your credit/debit card will be charged for your order upon delivery of your clothes. My Fresh Shirt will not process orders that use an incorrect, expired, or over-the-limit credit card. We will make our best efforts to contact you if this occurs. However, in the event such an order is processed, My Fresh Shirt reserves the right to collect funds for any uncollected transactions owed to it. My Fresh Shirt may charge a nominal processing fee of [$25 per order â€“ if payment hasn&rsquo;t been paid within 30 days] should your payment be declined resulting in the need for alternate payment or exception processing. If you fail to pay any fees or charges when due (which would include a rejected electronic payment) or if a redelivery fee is imposed, My Fresh Shirt may charge such amount directly to the credit card identified in your Customer Account Information and My Fresh Shirt may suspend or terminate your access to the My Fresh Shirt service. You shall be responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys&rsquo; fees and all associated collection costs, that My Fresh Shirt may incur in its efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you. Your right to use the My Fresh Shirt service is subject to limits established by My Fresh Shirt. </P
><P 
 align="justify"
><I>Price and Quality of service.</I> At My Fresh Shirt we believe in offering our customers high quality and convenient service at competitive prices. Although our goal is to provide you with prompt, reliable service, we may be prevented from performing our services for reasons that are beyond our control. In such cases, we will contact you as soon possible with notice of any expected delay. </P
