SitemapGenerator
================

Given a RESTful controller this will generate a Google sitemap for you.

script/generate sitemap [controller] [frequency]

example:

script/generate sitemap photos daily

will generate a photos/sitemap.rxml template which renders a sitemap 
amongst other things. Be sure to check out the generated controllers
since they hold the routes you need to add to config/routes.rb

Strictly speaking a RESTful controller is not necessary as long as 
the controller name is pluralized etc. You're better of going with the REST.

TODO: 

- output compression for large maps
- create multiple sitemaps in 1 go (script/generate sitemap photos movies mp3s)
