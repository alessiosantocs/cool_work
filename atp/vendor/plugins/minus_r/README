= MinusR Plugin

For those who don't quite buy the writing JavaScript in Ruby part of RJS and just want to write some real JavaScript.
Here's RJS minus the R.  This tiny plugin simply makes .rjs templates accept normal JavaScript and ERB:

   alert('No more silly Ruby in my JavaScript!');
   $('thing').update(<%=js render(:partial => 'boo') %>);

And so on.  Get the idea?  As you can see above the plugin provided the built in js helper that simply calls to_json
to turn your Ruby data into nice escaped strings.

That will be all.
