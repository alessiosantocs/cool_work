Description:
	The priceable migration generator creates a migration which you can use to generate three tables:
	
		currencies - Contains currency name, code (e.g. USD), and symbol (e.g. $)
		prices - This is where prices are stored
		pricings - This is our join model that maps prices to any other model/table.
	
	Two default currencies are included by default: USD and GBP
	
	To add your own you can modify the migration, create a new migration, or update the database with additional values.
	
	Note: Since currencies are cached process-wide, you will have to restart your app for access to new currencies in the database.
	
Example:
    ./script/generate priceable_migration add_priceable_tables

    With 4 existing migrations, this will create an AddPriceableTables migration in the
    file db/migrate/5_add_priceable_tables.rb
