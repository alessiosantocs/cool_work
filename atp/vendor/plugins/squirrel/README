SQL Simplification Plugin for ActiveRecord

This plugin extends the ActiveRecord::Base#find method to be able to
take a block of Ruby which will get parsed into a nice SQL string
and have its results returned.

Squirrel is a plugin for ActiveRecord which attempts to make SQL
querier a much more natural prospect. You can write your queries
in Ruby code and they get translated, including all proper table
joins, into relevant SQL code and executed, returning your results.
